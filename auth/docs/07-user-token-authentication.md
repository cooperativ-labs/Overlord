# USER_TOKEN Authentication Module

## Goal

Add a modular `USER_TOKEN` feature that lets each user create, inspect, rotate, revoke, and remove revoked long-lived tokens for CLI, agent, runner, and future API use. This feature should be designed as a separable authentication module so the database design can reserve the right ownership, lifecycle, and future permission-scoping concepts without forcing auth into the local unauthenticated MVP.

Use the name `USER_TOKEN` for this concept. Do not use agent-specific token naming in Overlord planning or implementation unless a migration note explicitly requires it.

## Position In The Roadmap

`USER_TOKEN` is not required for the first local-only CLI MVP. The local MVP can run as an implicit trusted user. Once Overlord supports real users, remote runners, HTTP APIs, MCP, or multi-device workflows, `USER_TOKEN` becomes the preferred non-interactive credential type.

Requirements:

- Treat `USER_TOKEN` as a module with clear service boundaries.
- Do not couple token storage directly to any one connector.
- Do not make tokens agent-specific; agents, CLI, runners, and future API clients can all use the same user-owned token mechanism.
- Design the module so future extensions can restrict token permissions without replacing the token lifecycle.

## Permission Model

Initial behavior:

- A `USER_TOKEN` confers all permissions of the user who created it.
- Authorization checks should resolve the token to its creating user, then evaluate the same permissions that user would have in the request's active workspace.
- The token itself does not have independent permission scope in the first implementation.
- When role-based access control is enabled, token requests should pass through the same authorization provider as interactive user requests.
- Tokens are workspace-agnostic authentication credentials: they are owned by the creating user account, visible/manageable only to that user, and usable across any workspace where that user has active membership. Workspace authorization remains per-workspace through RBAC.
- Consent narrows, it never grants. A token the user mints for themselves (CLI login, settings) consents to every current and future workspace in that user's organization and asks for no selection; a third-party OAuth client's token carries whatever the approval screen selected. Either way, effective access is that consent intersected with live membership and per-workspace RBAC.

Future behavior:

- Extensions may allow users to specify which permissions a token includes.
- Scoped tokens should be additive constraints on top of the creating user's current permissions, not a way to exceed them.
- A token should become less powerful if the creating user's permissions are reduced.
- A token should stop working for a workspace if the creating user is disabled, removed from that workspace, or otherwise loses access there.

Schema-planning implication:

- Model token ownership separately from future token grants/scopes.
- Leave room for token-level labels, metadata, expiration, revocation, and scope records.
- Avoid baking "full user permissions forever" into the persistence model.

## Token Lifecycle

### Create

Requirements:

- User can create a token from the CLI.
- `ovld auth login` on a cloud backend can create a full-scope token after a
  successful email/password session login and store that `USER_TOKEN` as the CLI
  credential.
- Future web app can create a token from settings.
- Token has a user-supplied label.
- Token creation defaults `expires_at` to 90 days from creation when no expiry is supplied
  when no expiry is supplied. Callers may pass an explicit expiry, or an explicit `null` to opt out
  and mint a non-expiring token.
- Manual token creation shows the raw token secret exactly once at creation.
  Tokens minted internally by cloud `ovld auth login` are stored directly as CLI
  credentials and are not printed.
- Persist only a secure hash of the token secret.
- Store a non-secret token identifier/prefix for lookup, display, and audit.
- Record creation time and creator user.

Suggested command:

```bash
ovld user-token create --label "macbook runner"
ovld user-token create --label "ci runner" --expires-in 90d
```

### List

Requirements:

- User can list their own tokens from the CLI, independent of the currently active workspace.
- Output must never reveal raw token secrets.
- Show identifier/prefix, label, created time, last used time, expiration, revoked status, and coarse use/context metadata when available.
- Other users in the same workspace must not see or manage these tokens unless they are also the token owner.

Suggested command:

```bash
ovld user-token list
ovld user-token list --json
```

### Revoke

Requirements:

- User can revoke a token from the CLI.
- Revoked tokens fail authentication immediately.
- Revocation should record time and actor.
- Revocation should be safe and idempotent.

Suggested command:

```bash
ovld user-token revoke <token-id-or-prefix>
```

### Rotate

Requirements:

- User can rotate a token from the CLI.
- Rotation should create a replacement secret and invalidate the old secret.
- The replacement secret is shown exactly once.
- Rotation should preserve useful metadata such as label unless explicitly changed.
- Rotation should record the predecessor relationship for audit and troubleshooting. The successor is derived by querying replacement tokens rather than stored as a second pointer.

Suggested commands:

```bash
ovld user-token rotate <token-id-or-prefix>
ovld user-token rotate <token-id-or-prefix> --label "new label"
```

### Rename

Requirements:

- User can update a token label without rotating the secret.

Suggested command:

```bash
ovld user-token rename <token-id-or-prefix> "office workstation"
```

## CLI And Environment Requirements

Requirements:

- The CLI should accept a `USER_TOKEN` through an environment variable for non-interactive use.
- Prefer `Overlord_USER_TOKEN` for Overlord-specific configuration.
- Optionally support `OVLD_USER_TOKEN` as a short alias.
- Avoid reusing upstream agent-specific token environment variable naming in new Overlord docs.
- `ovld auth status` should report whether a user token is present and usable without printing it.
- `ovld doctor` should detect malformed or revoked token configuration and suggest repair steps.

Example:

```bash
export Overlord_USER_TOKEN=out_...
ovld protocol attach --mission-id 1:1204
ovld runner start
```

Token commands should be grouped under either:

- `ovld user-token ...` for clear naming, or
- `ovld auth token ...` if the CLI later groups all auth commands together.

Pick one primary command group before implementation and keep aliases minimal.

## Protocol And API Requirements

Requirements:

- Protocol requests should authenticate with a `USER_TOKEN` when no local interactive session is available.
- Token authentication must resolve to a user identity before permission checks.
- Token authentication must not derive authorization scope from the token's issuance workspace. The request's active workspace preference is validated against the token owner's current memberships before RBAC runs.
- Protocol event history should attribute actions to the resolved user and, where useful, the token identifier.
- Token lifecycle operations should be available through CLI first and can later be exposed as local/web API endpoints.
- Token lifecycle operations must never return raw token secrets except from create/rotate responses.

Potential protocol commands:

- `ovld protocol auth-status`
- `ovld user-token create`
- `ovld user-token list`
- `ovld user-token revoke`
- `ovld user-token rotate`
- `ovld user-token rename`

## Security Requirements

- Store only token hashes, never raw secrets.
- Generate high-entropy secrets with a recognizable prefix such as `out_` for Overlord user token.
- Store a non-secret lookup prefix long enough to avoid routine collisions but short enough not to leak the secret; prefix collisions should fail safely at create/rotate time.
- Show the raw secret exactly once.
- Allow immediate revocation.
- Record last-used timestamp and, when safe, coarse client metadata.
- Do not log raw tokens.
- Redact token-like values in diagnostics.
- Treat tokens like passwords in docs and warnings.

## Scoped Permissions

Token scopes are now implemented. A token is created with a `scope`:

- `full` — no scope rows; the token inherits the full permissions of its creating user's roles.
- `mission_lifecycle` — persists grant patterns into `user_token_scopes`: `project:read`,
  `mission:*`, `objective:*`, `session:*`, `event:create`, `event:read`, `artifact:*`,
  `attachment:*`, `execution_request:{create,read,claim}`. This is everything a runner/agent needs
  and excludes project/user/role/connector administration and `user_token:self:*` (a scoped token
  cannot mint further tokens).

At authentication time the backend resolves the token to its creating `profile_id`, validates the
request's active workspace against that profile's current memberships, and then computes effective
permissions as the owner's role grants in that workspace **intersected with** the token's scope
grants (`grantCoversAction` over the scope patterns). Absence of scope rows means "no token-level
restriction". Scopes can only restrict, never exceed, the user's current role — if the user's role
is reduced in a workspace, the token becomes less powerful there automatically. Revocation and
expiry are checked before scope evaluation. The `requirePermission` gate enforces this uniformly
across REST, protocol, and runner routes.

The `ovld user-token create --scope full|mission-lifecycle` CLI flag and the webapp settings token
form both surface these two presets.

## Earlier Design Notes (now implemented)

The initial full-user-permission behavior was implemented through an authorization resolver that
later added scope checks, as described above.

Future scope examples:

- Read-only mission access.
- Create/update missions but not delete projects.
- Runner-only execution request claim/complete.
- Connector setup only.
- Project-limited access.
- Expiring CI token.

Requirements for future readiness:

- Token authentication should produce both user identity and token identity.
- Permission evaluation should be able to ask, "does this token further restrict this user's permission?"
- Scope absence in v1 means "no token-level restriction" rather than "unknown".
- Revocation and expiration must apply before scope evaluation.
- Token scopes should reuse the canonical permission names defined by the RBAC module.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The feature plan uses `USER_TOKEN` consistently.
- A user can create, list, rotate, rename, and revoke tokens from the CLI once auth is implemented.
- A `USER_TOKEN` initially confers exactly the creating user's current permissions in each active workspace where that user remains a member.
- The design leaves room for future token-level scopes without changing the user/token ownership model.
- Raw token secrets are never persisted or displayed after create/rotate.
