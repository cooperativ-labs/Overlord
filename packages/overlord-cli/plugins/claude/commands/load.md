Load Overlord ticket context without attaching to the ticket.

Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the target ticket ID.
If no ticket ID was provided, ask the user for one and stop.

Run:
`ovld protocol load-context --ticket-id <ticketId>`

Rules:
- Use `load-context`, not `attach`.
- Do not create or switch sessions.
- Summarize the returned ticket details, history, artifacts, and shared context for the user.
- If `ovld` reports `OVERLORD_URL` is unreachable, stop and request permission escalation or network access before retrying.
