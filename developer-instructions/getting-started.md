# Getting Started with Overlord

This guide walks you from a fresh `ovld` install to your first completed agent
mission in about ten minutes.

**What you'll have by the end:**

- A running local Overlord instance
- A project linked to a git repository
- An agent connector installed in your harness (Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor)
- A delivered mission with change rationales you can inspect

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (needed to run the CLI)
- **A running Overlord backend**:
  - Local mode: run the Desktop app or a local backend listening on
    `http://127.0.0.1:4310`.
  - Cloud mode: use the URL for a hosted Overlord backend.
- **`ovld` installed** — install from the published tarball or build from source:

  ```bash
  # From a release tarball
  npm install -g --no-fund overlord-cli-<version>.tgz

  # From source (builds the CLI, then symlinks or adds to PATH)
  yarn build:cli:prod
  node cli/bin/ovld.mjs version   # smoke-test: prints the version
  ```

- **A git repository** you want Overlord to manage work in (can be any project)

---

## Step 1 — Point `ovld` at a backend

Run this after installing the CLI:

```bash
ovld auth login
```

`auth login` verifies that the CLI has a backend URL. If not, it walks you
through `ovld config` first. Local mode defaults to the Desktop/local backend at
`http://127.0.0.1:4310`; cloud mode stores the hosted backend URL.

You can configure the backend non-interactively:

```bash
# Local Desktop/local backend
ovld config set local
ovld config set local http://127.0.0.1:4310

# Hosted backend
ovld config set cloud https://overlord.example.com
```

The resulting `overlord.toml` stores the backend target:

```toml
instance_name = "Local Overlord"
backend_mode = "local"
backend_url = "http://127.0.0.1:4310"
default_agent = "claude"
```

The published npm CLI does not create or migrate SQLite. SQLite lives behind the
Desktop/local backend; Postgres lives behind a hosted backend.

> **Setting up a team or custom instance?** See
> [Setting Up a Custom Overlord Instance](custom-instance-setup.md) for
> the full decision guide (database choice, schema groups, `overlord.toml`
> fields, and multi-user auth).

Verify everything looks good:

```bash
ovld doctor
ovld config list
```

---

## Step 2 — Set up your organization and workspace

A brand-new, authenticated profile with zero workspace memberships needs an
**organization** (the grouping + identity layer, e.g. a company or team) and a
first **workspace** (the RBAC layer projects live inside) before it can create
projects. `ovld org-setup` drives the same onboarding endpoint the web app's
onboarding screen uses, so the two can never drift:

```bash
ovld org-setup --org-name "Acme" --workspace-name "general"
```

Omit the flags on an interactive terminal and it prompts for them; pass
`--no-input` in scripts to fail fast on anything missing. `--if-needed` exits
`0` as a no-op once you already belong to an organization, so bootstrap
scripts can call it unconditionally. See the command reference for the full
flag list (including `--logo`).

If you were invited to an existing workspace, skip this step — you already
have a membership, and `org-setup` will tell you so.

---

## Step 3 — Create a project and link it to your repo

A **project** is Overlord's container for missions. It knows which git repository
holds the work and which local directory to use when launching an agent.

```bash
# Create a project and point it at your repo directory
ovld create-project --name "My App" --directory /path/to/your/repo

# If you are already inside the repo directory, link it to the project
ovld add-cwd --primary true
```

Overlord stores a `.overlord/project.json` file in the linked directory so
future commands can resolve the project automatically. That file is local-only
metadata. It can retain target-specific resource ids when the same checkout is
linked on more than one execution target, and it can list every project the
checkout is linked to. When more than one project is present, cwd-based
commands use the project with `isPrimary: true` (whichever project most
recently set this resource as primary) unless you pass `--project-id`.

---

## Step 4 — Configure Overlord

Run the guided setup to choose a local or cloud backend, configure agent
connectors, and pick the default terminal used for launched agents:

```bash
ovld setup
```

For local mode, setup asks whether the Desktop app is installed. If it is not,
it prints the latest Desktop download URL before writing the local backend URL.

---

## Step 5 — Install or repair an agent connector directly

Connectors let your AI harness (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …) speak the
Overlord protocol and receive mission context automatically.

```bash
# See what connectors are available
ovld agent-setup

# Install the Claude Code connector
ovld agent-setup claude

# Install all supported connectors at once
ovld agent-setup all

# Verify the install
ovld doctor
```

The connector installs a plugin into the harness and wires up the
`UserPromptSubmit` hook so mission context is injected at prompt time. You only
need to do this once per harness; re-running `ovld agent-setup <agent>` repairs
or updates it.

---

## Step 6 — Create your first mission

A **mission** is a unit of work. It holds one or more sequential **objectives**,
each of which maps to one agent session. Create a mission with a single
objective:

```bash
# Simple one-objective mission
ovld create "Add a user-facing error message when the upload fails"

# Multi-objective mission (plan then implement)
ovld create "Refactor the auth middleware" \
  --objectives-json '[
    {"objective": "Draft a plan for the auth middleware refactor"},
    {"objective": "Implement the refactor per the plan"}
  ]'
```

The command prints the mission ID (e.g. `1:1042`). You can also list missions:

```bash
ovld missions list --status next-up,execute
```

---

## Step 7 — Launch an agent on the mission

```bash
ovld launch claude --mission-id 1:1042
```

This opens a terminal window with Claude Code pointed at your repository, with
the mission context pre-loaded. The agent will attach (`ovld protocol attach`),
do the work, post progress updates, and deliver when done.

> **Tip:** `ovld runner start` keeps a background process that claims missions
> from the queue automatically — useful when you have many missions to run
> through.

---

## Step 8 — Review the results

Once the agent delivers, inspect what it produced:

```bash
# Read the delivery summary
ovld mission deliveries 1:1042

# See all file changes with rationale
ovld changes rationales --mission-id 1:1042

# Diff the exact changes
ovld changes diff --mission-id 1:1042

# Full mission context (history, shared state, artifacts)
ovld mission context 1:1042
```

The change rationales explain what each file change does and why — an audit
trail that lives alongside the diff.

---

## Step 9 — Open the web app (optional)

```bash
yarn dev
```

From a source checkout, this starts the local web/API backend at
`http://127.0.0.1:4310` — a Kanban board where you can create, edit, and launch
missions without using the CLI. In a packaged install, Desktop owns starting and
supervising the local backend.

### Checkout-local features (Desktop vs browser)

Repository browsing, `@` mentions, branch lists, branch actions, and worktree
management run **on your machine** — not on the hosted control plane. For the
full product experience, use **Overlord Desktop** (Electron). The desktop shell
exposes `window.overlord.invokeLocalTarget`, which routes git/fs work through the
same capability bodies as the CLI.

| Surface | Postgres (Cloud) | Loopback SQLite (local dev) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Overlord Desktop** | Full checkout/git via IPC bridge | Full checkout/git via IPC bridge |
| **Browser only** | Degraded — control-plane metadata only; UI shows `LocalTargetRequiredNotice` where git is needed | Degraded by default; optional dev proxy (below) |

The web app reads `GET /api/meta` → `capabilities.localTarget` to decide whether
a browser session can call the server's in-process dev proxy:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unavailable` | No server-side checkout proxy. Use Desktop, or (SQLite only) enable the dev flag below. |
| `in_process_server` | Opt-in dev fallback: browser may `POST /api/local-target/invoke` on loopback SQLite only. |

**Browser-only local dev (contributors):** when running `yarn dev` against
loopback SQLite, you can enable the in-process server proxy without Electron:

```bash
# In repo-root .env.local (or export before starting the server)
OVERLORD_DEV_IN_PROCESS_LOCAL_TARGET=true
```

Then restart the web/API server. This path is **for local development only** —
it is disabled on Postgres backends and is not a substitute for Desktop in
production or Cloud workspaces.

**Upgrading Cloud workspaces:** if your workspace predates the client checkout
bridge, run `ovld doctor` against your hosted backend and follow
[`developer-instructions/upgrading-client-checkout-bridge.md`](upgrading-client-checkout-bridge.md)
when stale backend-host execution targets are reported.

## Step 10 — Inspect the database with SQL Studio (optional)

The local backend can launch [SQL Studio](https://github.com/frectonz/sql-studio),
an external local database browser, alongside the web app so you can inspect
the local Overlord database directly. It is **off by default** — you opt in per
instance.

**1. Install the `sql-studio` binary.** It is a standalone tool, not bundled
with Overlord. Install it via its release script or with Cargo, then confirm it
is on your `PATH`:

```bash
# Release install script (see the project README for the latest command)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/frectonz/sql-studio/releases/latest/download/sql-studio-installer.sh | sh

# …or with Cargo
cargo install sql-studio

# Confirm it resolves
sql-studio --version
```

**2. Enable it in `overlord.toml`.** Add (or flip) these keys next to your
existing config:

```toml
sql_studio_enabled = true
sql_studio_host     = "127.0.0.1"
sql_studio_port     = 4311
sql_studio_binary   = "sql-studio"   # name on PATH, or an absolute path
```

| Setting | `overlord.toml` key | Env override | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable SQL Studio | `sql_studio_enabled` | `OVERLORD_SQL_STUDIO_ENABLED` | `false` |
| Bind host | `sql_studio_host` | `OVERLORD_SQL_STUDIO_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` |
| Bind port | `sql_studio_port` | `OVERLORD_SQL_STUDIO_PORT` | `4311` |
| Binary name or path | `sql_studio_binary` | `OVERLORD_SQL_STUDIO_BINARY` | `"sql-studio"` |

**3. Activate it.** SQL Studio starts as part of the web app, so just (re)start
the server:

```bash
ovld serve
```

On startup you'll see a `[sql-studio] launching http://127.0.0.1:4311` line, and
the web app sidebar shows an **Open SQL Studio** button that opens the browser
pointed at your Overlord SQLite database. If the binary can't be found, the
server logs a warning and keeps running without it — fix the install or
`sql_studio_binary` path and restart.

> **Keep it local.** Leave SQL Studio disabled on shared or production
> instances; it is meant for local inspection only.
