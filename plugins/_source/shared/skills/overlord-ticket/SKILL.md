# Overlord Ticket

Use this skill whenever {{agent.productName}} needs to work with Overlord, whether the session was launched by Overlord Desktop/CLI or the user asks from chat to engage with Overlord.

## Mode 1: Launched From Overlord Desktop Or CLI

Use this mode when the prompt already contains a ticket ID or explicitly says the session was launched by Overlord.

1. Attach first with `ovld protocol attach --ticket-id <ticket_id>`.
2. The attach response prints JSON to stdout containing `session.sessionKey`. The CLI also persists this key automatically so subsequent `ovld protocol` commands in the same working directory resolve it without `--session-key`. If auto-resolution fails, pass `--session-key <sessionKey>` explicitly on every subsequent call.
3. Treat the Overlord ticket prompt as authoritative for the objective, constraints, and delivery target.
4. Post updates while working: `ovld protocol update --session-key <sessionKey> --ticket-id <ticket_id> --summary "..." --phase execute`.
   During long mechanical stretches with nothing meaningful to post, send `ovld protocol heartbeat --session-key <sessionKey> --ticket-id <ticket_id> [--phase execute] [--percent <0-100>] [--note "..."]` instead of an empty update.
5. Follow-up messages after the initial ticket are captured automatically by the installed {{hookDescription}} and stay in discussion intent while the ticket is in review. Do not post `user_follow_up` manually unless the hook is unavailable.
6. If blocked, call `ovld protocol ask --session-key <sessionKey> --ticket-id <ticket_id> --question "..."` and stop.
7. Deliver last with `ovld protocol deliver --session-key <sessionKey> --ticket-id <ticket_id> --summary "..."`, including `changeRationales` for each meaningful behavioral file change.

For full command syntax, flags, phase values, and event types see [reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md).

## Tickets vs Objectives

**Tickets** represent whole features or goals. **Objectives** are the individual steps to implement that goal — one objective equals one agent prompt.

Example:
```
Ticket: add CLI command for editing user profile
 - Objective 1: draft plan for this command
 - Objective 2: implement phase 1 of plan
 - Objective 3: implement phase 2 of plan
 - Objective 4: update documentation
```

When to create a ticket vs an objective:
- **Create a new ticket** when the user describes a distinct feature, bug, or goal that stands on its own.
- **Add objectives to an existing ticket** when the work is a sequential step toward the same feature or goal already tracked in a ticket.

To add further objectives to an existing ticket (Mode 2):
```
ovld protocol add-objectives --ticket-id <ticket_id> --objectives-json '[{"objective":"..."},{"objective":"..."}]'
```

## Objective Submission vs Execution

Discussing or otherwise opening a ticket from within a chat should cause the draft objective to be marked **submitted** — this signals the ticket is in active discussion with an agent, but not yet being executed. Only an explicit order to execute (e.g. "execute this", "do this", "start working on it") should cause you to **attach** to the ticket and trigger execution.

- **Discussing / opening a ticket** → `ovld protocol discuss-objective --ticket-id $TICKET_ID` (draft → submitted, no session).
- **Creating a ticket** via `ovld protocol create` keeps the objective in `draft` state.
- **Explicitly ordered to execute** → `ovld protocol attach --ticket-id $TICKET_ID` (draft/submitted → executing, session begins).

Do not attach to a ticket just because it was mentioned or opened in conversation. Only attach when the user clearly asks you to execute the work.

## Mode 2: Asked From Chat To Use Overlord

Use this mode when the conversation starts normally and the user asks {{agent.displayName}} to create, inspect, connect to, or otherwise use Overlord.

1. If the user wants to create tickets (and does not ask to start execution), {{#if hasSlashCommands}}use `{{agent.slashPrefix}}create` or {{/if}}run `ovld protocol create --agent {{agent.protocolAgent}} --objectives-json '[{"objective":"..."}]'`.
   - When `--session-key` and `--ticket-id` are provided, it creates a follow-up draft.
   - When session flags are omitted, it resolves the project by matching current working directory (or `--working-directory`) to Overlord project resource directories, then creates a standalone draft.
   - Pass multiple items in `--objectives-json` when creating ordered steps for the same feature or goal.
   - If the user wants to **add more objectives to an existing ticket** (not create a new ticket), use `ovld protocol add-objectives --ticket-id <ticket_id> --objectives-json '[{"objective":"..."}]'` instead.
2. Default to `create` for new tickets. Only use {{#if hasSlashCommands}}`{{agent.slashPrefix}}prompt` or {{/if}}`ovld protocol prompt --agent {{agent.protocolAgent}} --objectives-json '[{"objective":"..."}]'` when the user explicitly asks to create and execute immediately.
   `prompt` creates the ticket in `execute` status and attaches immediately.
3. If the user already has a ticket ID and only wants to inspect it, {{#if hasSlashCommands}}use `{{agent.slashPrefix}}load` or {{/if}}run `ovld protocol load-context --ticket-id <ticket_id>`.
   When you open or discuss an existing ticket that has a draft objective, submit it with `ovld protocol discuss-objective --ticket-id <ticket_id>`.
4. If the user wants to route the current session onto an existing ticket by ID, {{#if hasSlashCommands}}use `{{agent.slashPrefix}}connect` or {{/if}}run `ovld protocol connect --ticket-id <ticket_id>`.
5. If the user wants to establish a persistent session with a ticket by ID, {{#if hasSlashCommands}}use `{{agent.slashPrefix}}attach` or {{/if}}run `ovld protocol attach --ticket-id <ticket_id>`.
6. If the user wants to find a ticket but does not know the ID, run `ovld protocol search-tickets --query "..." --status next-up,execute` and ask the user to confirm. {{#if isClaude}}For interactive ticket search and agent launch, prefer `ovld attach`.{{/if}}
7. If you need to understand project routing before prompting, use `ovld protocol discover-project`.
8. If you need other lifecycle commands or flags, run `ovld protocol help` and use the real subcommand list instead of guessing.
9. Once you attach to a ticket, switch back to Mode 1 and follow the full ticket lifecycle.

For ticket creation examples, project discovery, and `--objectives-json` format see [reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md).

## Change Rationales

Always include `changeRationales` when delivering. Optionally include them on updates during long-running work.

Before delivering, make sure every meaningful git-tracked file change is represented in `changeRationales`; do not send `file_changes` as an artifact. Record only meaningful behavioral changes. Skip formatting-only noise.

Each rationale entry requires these fields: `file_path`, `label`, `summary`, `why`, `impact` — all strings. Do **not** use `filePath` or `rationale`; those are a different internal shape and will cause a validation error.

For more than a handful of entries, use `--change-rationales-file` with a temp file or stdin (`-`) instead of inline `--change-rationales-json` to avoid shell quoting failures with large arrays.

For the `record-change-rationales` command and full payload shape with optional `hunks` see [reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md).

## Rules

- Always attach first and always deliver last once you are on a ticket.
- Use `ovld protocol` commands{{#if isClaude}} and the plugin's slash commands{{/if}}{{#if isCursor}}, the plugin commands, and the MCP tool{{/if}}{{#if isCodex}} and the plugin's MCP tools{{/if}} instead of ad hoc scripts.
- Do not invent protocol subcommands. Use `ovld protocol help` when unsure.
- Include at least one progress update before delivering.
- After delivery, answer ordinary questions and clarifications in discussion mode; only begin follow-up execution when the user explicitly asks for file or code changes.
- When explicit follow-up implementation starts on a delivered/review ticket, call `ovld protocol update --begin-follow-up-work --follow-up-intent execution --summary "Beginning follow-up work."` before code changes or `--phase execute`.
- During follow-up execution, post progress updates and record change rationales for each file modified, the same as during initial execution.
- Record important non-file decisions with `--event-type decision` or `--event-type discussion_summary`.
- The `summary` in deliver is what the PM reads first, so write it as a narrative, not a command list.
- When a summary or question contains backticks, `$vars`, or other shell-special characters, always use `--summary-file -` (or `--question-file -`) with a single-quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`). Never retry by stripping or escaping content — pipe stdin instead. See [reference/shell-escaping.md](reference/shell-escaping.md).
- Use `write-context` for facts a future agent session should know.
- If a protocol or MCP call fails with auth/session errors, run `ovld auth repair` yourself before asking the user to log in again or proceed without Overlord updates.
- If you must run `ovld auth login`, `--organization-id <id>` is optional — use it only when you want to set a different default organization than the CLI would choose automatically.
- Do not add or commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to commit.{{#if isCodex}}
- Do not create or rely on a local Codex `AGENTS.md` bundle for Overlord.{{/if}}
- Delivery is the concluding step. After delivering, stop implementation work unless the user explicitly asks for follow-up execution; once follow-up execution is complete, deliver again.
