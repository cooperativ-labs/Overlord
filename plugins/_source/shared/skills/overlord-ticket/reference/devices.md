# Execution Targets And Checkout Paths

Execution targets are canonical rows keyed by a real `device_fingerprint` when known, or by an SSH placeholder until the remote target registers. Organization labels, user access, SSH credential references, and project membership live in separate association rows. Persist a fingerprint per workstation, upsert via `ovld protocol get-device`, then maintain checkout paths via `list-project-resources`, `add-project-resource`, `update-project-resource`, and `update-device` (`ovld protocol help` lists flags).

```bash
ovld protocol get-device --device-fingerprint "$OVERLORD_DEVICE_FINGERPRINT"
ovld protocol list-project-resources --project-id <project_uuid> --device-fingerprint "$OVERLORD_DEVICE_FINGERPRINT"
```

`ovld runner start` uses the same execution target identity and project resource directories to claim queued execution requests from manual Run and auto-advance. Primary resource directories are scoped per `(project, execution target)`. `ovld runner once` claims at most one request and exits.

## Choosing `--for-human`

Pass `--for-human agent` or `--for-human human` (default: `human`) when creating tickets.

- **`agent`** — any task an AI agent can complete in a computer environment: coding, internet research, document editing, data analysis, automated testing, etc.
- **`human`** — any task requiring human presence or judgment: setting credentials or tokens in a third-party UI (e.g. Vercel, AWS), sending physical mail, making a product or business decision, physical-world actions.

When in doubt, ask yourself: _can this be done entirely inside a terminal or browser by an AI without human intervention?_ If yes → `agent`. If it requires a human to log in, decide, or act in the real world → `human`.
