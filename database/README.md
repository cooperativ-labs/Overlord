# Database Module

Overlord's persistence layer. PostgreSQL is the authoritative database for
shared/private-network deployments; SQLite remains the default local development
database. The schema is defined as a portable contract so adapters can implement
it and pass conformance tests. This module also hosts the **extension system** —
the sanctioned ways to extend the schema without forking it.

## For Users

### Persistence modes

Overlord stores projects, missions, objectives, events, and other data behind a
backend service. Local mode uses a backend running on your machine (Desktop
today, and possibly a future db-only local backend) that owns SQLite and
migrations. Cloud mode uses a hosted backend that owns Postgres. The published
`overlord-cli` CLI is a client of one of those backends; it does not open
SQLite directly or ship `better-sqlite3`.

Configure the backend target in `overlord.toml` (`backend_url`) or through
`ovld config set local|cloud`. See the [CLI module README](../cli/README.md) for
setup details.

The first-pass portable schema proposal is documented in the
[schema contract](docs/09-database-schema-contract.md). Users can extend or
customize the schema through component-scoped migrations, namespaced metadata,
and documented extension points — see [Extension surface](#extension-surface)
below.

### Extension surface

Extend the schema only through the sanctioned paths: `ext_<name>_`-prefixed
tables with `schema_migrations.component = 'ext:<name>'`, namespaced JSON
metadata keys, and reactions via service APIs / `entity_changes` / `outbox_messages`
— never direct writes to core tables. See the Extension Points section of
[`CONTRACT.md`](../CONTRACT.md) and [`contract/extension-points.yaml`](../contract/extension-points.yaml).

## For Developers

### Contract Components

This module is the developer-facing home for two components in
[`CONTRACT.md`](../CONTRACT.md):

| Component | Stable id | What it owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database Layer | `database` | Table/column definitions, indexes, FKs, CHECK constraints, controlled vocabularies, soft-delete/revision semantics, migration versioning, logical types |
| Extension System | `extension` | `user_harness_extensions` authoring + `workspace_harness_extensions` promotion, `ext_<name>_` table namespace, `ext:<name>` migration component naming, namespaced JSON metadata keys |

The Database Layer does **not** own service-layer business logic or REST
response shapes (→ [webapp module](../webapp/README.md)).

### Code & Tests (colocated)

This module is the `@overlord/database` workspace package. Its runtime lives in
[`database/src/`](src/) and is consumed by backend processes, the root service
layer, and the auth module through the package name (`@overlord/database`)
rather than cross-folder relative imports:

- `connection.ts` — open/migrate a SQLite database, list migrations, in-memory
  test databases. Migrations are resolved relative to this package, so the same
  code works from source, from the built `dist/`, and from packaged local
  backend/Desktop builds.
- `launch-local.ts` — the `yarn db:start` local launcher.
- `constants.ts` — database-layer constants and controlled vocabularies
  (statuses, objective states, update phases/events, seed IDs, contract version).
- `local-paths.ts` — canonical local-data paths: the per-user global database
  directory (`~/.ovld/`, overridable via `OVLD_HOME`) plus the repo-local
  `database/.local/…` storage-bucket paths.
- `adapter.ts` — `resolveAdapter()`, the single point that decides SQLite vs.
  PostgreSQL from the `overlord.toml` `database_url` admin setting or the
  `DATABASE_URL` environment variable so auth and the service layer never disagree.

The published `overlord-cli` CLI does not bundle this package. It talks to a
configured backend URL; local/cloud backend packages own database adapters and
migrations.

Migrations live here, numbered sequentially — see [Migrations](#migrations).

### Applying Locally

Use the Node-based local launcher for the default SQLite development database:

```sh
yarn start:local
```

This creates the SQLite database at the per-user global path `~/.ovld/Overlord.sqlite` (override with `OVLD_HOME` or `OVERLORD_SQLITE_PATH`), enables SQLite foreign keys, WAL mode,
and a short busy timeout for the launch connection, discovers
`database/sqlite/migrations/*.sql`, applies any unapplied core SQLite migrations
in lexical version order, and records each applied migration in
`schema_migrations` with a SHA-256 checksum. Set
`OVERLORD_SQLITE_PATH=/path/to/Overlord.sqlite` to launch a database file
outside the default location.

Do not edit a migration after it has been applied to a database you care about.
Create a new forward-only migration such as `005_add_mission_labels.sql`; the
next backend startup applies it without wiping existing rows. If the checksum of
an already-applied migration changes, startup fails so the mismatch can be fixed
instead of silently rewriting history.

If `yarn start:local` fails with `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED`
or `invalid ELF header` while loading `better-sqlite3`, the repo is using a
`node_modules` tree built for a different OS or CPU architecture. Reinstall
dependencies inside the same environment where you run Overlord:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

Manual SQL application remains useful for adapter experiments:

```sh
sqlite3 database/.local/Overlord.sqlite < database/sqlite/migrations/001_better_auth.sql
sqlite3 database/.local/Overlord.sqlite < database/sqlite/migrations/002_initial_core.sql
sqlite3 database/.local/Overlord.sqlite < database/sqlite/migrations/003_rbac.sql
sqlite3 database/.local/Overlord.sqlite < database/sqlite/migrations/004_storage.sql

psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/postgres/migrations/001_initial_core.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/postgres/migrations/002_rbac.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/postgres/migrations/003_better_auth.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f database/postgres/migrations/004_storage.sql
```

Each migration enables SQLite foreign-key checks for the connection. The local
launcher records the corresponding `schema_migrations` row with its computed
checksum after each migration commits. Real initialization code may replace the
seed IDs with generated stable IDs, but tests can rely on the deterministic
values from these migrations.

### Migrations

#### `sqlite/migrations/001_initial_core.sql` and `postgres/migrations/001_initial_core.sql`
Core MVP slice: all tables for the local mission/objective/session workflow, the
change feed, and idempotency. Seeds deterministic rows for the default local
workspace, implicit user, workspace membership, and workspace-scoped mission sequence.

The PostgreSQL migration uses native `jsonb`, `boolean`, `timestamptz`, and a
`bigint` identity cursor for `entity_changes.seq`. It also adds a claimable
queue index for `execution_requests` so service-layer runner claims can use
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` efficiently.

#### `sqlite/migrations/002_rbac.sql` and `postgres/migrations/002_rbac.sql`
Group 1 (Multi-User Access and API Tokens):
- `role_assignments` — durable workspace-user-to-role membership. Empty-string sentinels for `resource_type`/`resource_id` represent workspace-level scope so the unique-active-assignment index works on both SQLite and Postgres.
- `user_tokens` — USER_TOKEN metadata and hashes only; raw secrets are never stored.
- `user_token_scopes` — reserved for future token-level permission restrictions.

Seeds an `ADMIN` role assignment for the implicit local workspace user. This
provides the schema foundation for the [Auth module](../auth/README.md); the
authorization logic itself lives above the database layer.

#### `sqlite/migrations/003_better_auth.sql` and `postgres/migrations/003_better_auth.sql`
Auth-owned Better Auth implementation tables (`user`, `session`, `account`,
`verification`) in the same adapter database. No other component should read or
write these tables directly.
