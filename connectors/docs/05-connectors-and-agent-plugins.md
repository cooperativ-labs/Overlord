# Connectors And Agent Plugins

## Goal

Port Overlord's connector model so Overlord can launch different AI coding agents while giving each one the same mission protocol, lifecycle rules, hooks, and context.

## Connector Model

Overlord should keep four layers distinct:

- Connector core: canonical Markdown workflow instructions and protocol rules.
- Connector plugins: per-agent files that extend the core for a specific harness.
- Plugin adapters: packaging/install glue for each agent's native plugin system.
- Prompt wrappers: launch-time task and context text passed to the agent.

Requirements:

- The core workflow should be reusable across agents.
- Per-agent differences should live in connector adapters, not duplicated protocol rules.
- Setup must be idempotent.
- Doctor must detect stale, missing, or partially installed connector files.
- Connector files should avoid clobbering user settings.

## Canonical Connector Core

Source location:

- `connectors/core/overlord-mission/SKILL.md`
- `connectors/core/overlord-mission/reference/`

This is the single source of truth for durable Overlord workflow behavior. Connector adapters ship a thin harness-specific skill template with a `<!-- @connector-core -->` marker; `ovld agent-setup` interpolates this core into the installed plugin. Adapters must not duplicate the core lifecycle rules.

Required content:

- Attach first.
- Treat mission prompt/context as authoritative.
- Post meaningful progress updates.
- Include changed-file tracking with normal progress updates when the CLI/runtime can do so without extra agent calls.
- Use heartbeat during long mechanical work with no meaningful update.
- Ask exactly one blocking question and stop when blocked.
- Deliver last with summary, artifacts, and change rationales.
- Never revert, restore, or delete concurrent work from other agents or missions to deliver; ask instead.
- Record all meaningful file changes as structured rationales.
- Use stdin/file flags for shell-special content.
- Use stdin/file flags for oversized JSON payloads (`--*-json` values above ~8 KB are rejected; use `--*-file -`).
- Do not continue implementation after delivery unless follow-up execution is explicitly requested.
- Run local repair/diagnostic commands before asking the user to fix connector setup.

## Canonical Local MCP Shim

Source location:

- `connectors/core/scripts/overlord-mcp.mjs`

Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity each install a local stdio MCP bridge that delegates to `ovld protocol`. All three are rendered from this one core script at `ovld agent-setup` time: the adapter key is substituted for `__OVERLORD_ADAPTER_KEY__` in `DEFAULT_AGENT` and `serverInfo.name`. Adapter directories contain no committed copy — edit the core file.

Requirements:

- The rendered shim must remain a standalone runnable `.mjs`; harnesses start it directly from the install path, so no bundler or repo-local import may appear at runtime.
- Adapter-specific behavior beyond the agent identifier belongs in the adapter, not in a fork of the shim.
- The shim tool list must stay in parity with the hosted MCP catalog (`mcp/tool-catalog.ts`).
- `serverInfo.version` follows `connectors/VERSION` through `scripts/sync-connector-versions.mjs`.

## Canonical Post-Tool Capture Callback

`connectors/core/scripts/capture-change-hook.sh` is the only implementation of the local
post-tool mutation callback. Setup substitutes the adapter key and installs it at the unchanged
harness-native paths:

- Claude: `scripts/post-tool-use-hook.sh`
- Codex: `scripts/post-tool-use-hook.sh`
- Cursor: `hooks/overlord-post-tool-use.sh`

The adapter hook registrations and managed paths remain native; adapter directories do not carry
copies of the script. Fixtures render the same core source before exercising bound and unbound
behavior.

## Adapter Capability Differences

Adapters intentionally differ in which mechanisms they ship. The per-adapter matrix, the omissions that are decisions, and the gaps that are merely unported are recorded in the [connectors module README](../README.md#adapter-capability-matrix). Update that table when an adapter gains or drops a mechanism.

## Codex Connector

Requirements:

- Install a home-local Codex plugin.
- Include Overlord skill/workflow instructions.
- Include `UserPromptSubmit` hook to record follow-up messages.
- The `UserPromptSubmit` hook should call `ovld protocol hook-event` with
  `--hook-type UserPromptSubmit`, `--mission-id`, the prompt text, optional
  native `--external-session-id`, and optional `--session-key`. The session key
  must be optional because delivered sessions may be ended before a user sends a
  follow-up.
- Hook capture records `user_follow_up` activity only. It must not reopen an
  objective for implementation; agents do that later with
  `ovld protocol resume-follow-up` when the user explicitly asks for file or
  code changes.
- Include permission hook to record tool permission requests.
- Install protocol permission rules for `ovld protocol`.
- During interactive Codex setup, ask `Configure Codex permissions to allow it to communicate with the Overlord server?` (default yes). On acceptance, merge the `overlord` workspace permission profile into `~/.codex/config.toml`: make it the default permission profile, disable `js_repl`, enable the network proxy, and allow only `**.ovld.ai` network access for that profile. Non-interactive `ovld agent-setup codex` applies the same idempotent merge so scripted setup remains usable.
- Avoid generating or relying on a repository-local `AGENTS.md` for Overlord itself.
- Detect or receive Codex native session/thread IDs when possible.
- Launch with model and reasoning effort mapping:
  - `--model <model>`
  - `-c model_reasoning_effort="<level>"`
- For large context or wrappers, write a context file and pass a short prompt that points to it.

Setup/managed files should be documented once implementation paths are chosen. Upstream uses `~/.codex/plugins/overlord`, `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, Codex rules, and hook scripts.

## Claude Code Connector

Requirements:

- Install a Claude plugin/skill bundle.
- Extend the shared Connector Core with a Claude-specific overlay instead of owning copied protocol workflow rules.
- Include `UserPromptSubmit` hook.
- Include permission hook.
- Optionally include Stop hook for pending-delivery checks.
- Provide slash commands for protocol operations.
- Preserve existing Claude settings.
- Launch with:
  - `--append-system-prompt-file <context-file>`
  - `--model <model>`
  - `--effort <level>` when supported.

Setup should work without the desktop app and should not fail hard when the Claude binary is absent; warn and report through doctor.

## Cursor Connector

Can be implemented after Codex and Claude.

Requirements:

- Install local Cursor plugin/rules/commands.
- Add `beforeSubmitPrompt` hook to record follow-ups.
- Wire `beforeShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, and `preToolUse` to the Agent
  Session Module's blocking Decide capability (`ovld agent-session request`) per
  the descriptor — Cursor has no single universal `PermissionRequest` event, so
  do not route all three through one shared hook. See
  `connectors/adapters/cursor/CAPABILITIES.md` for current per-capability status.
- Add `postToolUse` edit capture for file tools and shell-mediated changes.
- Add a bounded `stop` hook for pending-delivery reminders.
- Add permission allow rules for protocol commands.
- Launch with model flag where supported.
- No thinking/effort flag required initially.

## PI Connector

Requirements:

- Install the Overlord Agent Skill and extension beneath `~/.pi/agent`.
- Use PI's `input` extension event only for `UserPromptSubmit` follow-up capture; PI has no native permission-request hook.
- Record PI's native session ID through the existing `~/.ovld/native-sessions` cache so the review UI can offer `pi --session <id>`.
- Launch with provider-qualified models via `--model <provider/id>` and independent thinking via `--thinking <level>`.
- Pass the generated mission context as PI's native `@<context-file>` input and retain a short visible launch message.

## Antigravity Connector

Can be implemented after local MVP.

Requirements:

- Install Antigravity plugin.
- Provide protocol skill and commands.
- Use Antigravity model selection internally rather than passing model flags if that remains the harness behavior.
- Keep local MCP shim parity with CLI protocol commands where useful.

## OpenCode And Custom Agents

Requirements:

- Support command templates from built-in connector metadata and custom harness extension records.
- Allow custom agent identifiers and command arguments.
- Provide a generic prompt wrapper when no native plugin exists.
- Mark connector capability support, such as:
  - supports native resume
  - supports model flag
  - supports effort/thinking flag
  - supports follow-up hook
  - supports permission hook
  - supports context-file prompt

Custom harness extension storage:

- Built-in packaged harnesses such as Codex and Claude Code live in the Overlord connector registry.
- User-authored custom harnesses live in `user_harness_extensions` as personal extension definitions and versions.
- Workspace-approved custom harnesses live in `workspace_harness_extensions` as snapshot catalog entries.
- `connector_installations` tracks local setup/doctor state only; it must not be the source of truth for authored custom harness definitions.
- Local extension bundle files can live under `~/.ovld/extensions/<extension-key>/<version>/`; hosted or synced deployments should store bundle files in managed blob storage and keep only URIs, manifests, and checksums in the database.
- Adding a personal extension to a workspace should snapshot a specific version so later personal edits do not silently change workspace behavior.

## Slash Commands

For agents with command/plugin support, provide commands for:

- `attach`
- `connect`
- `load`
- `create`
- `prompt`
- `discuss-objective`
- `add-objectives`
- `record-work`
- `spawn` or equivalent follow-up mission creation if useful

Each command should call the same `ovld protocol` surface rather than duplicating behavior.

## Hook Requirements

### Follow-Up Hook

Requirements:

- Captures human follow-up messages after initial mission prompt.
- Publishes `user_follow_up` events through `hook-event` or `update`.
- Preserves verbatim user text.
- Records native session/resume ID when the harness exposes one.
- Does not restart execution by itself.

### Permission Hook (Decide capability)

This is the Agent Session Module's **Decide** capability, not a one-way event
push. See `planning/feature-plans/agent-session-module.md` and
`docs/src/content/docs/docs-for-agents/agent-sessions.mdx` for the current
architecture; `connectors/HARNESS-MATRIX.md` for live per-adapter status.

Requirements:

- Creates an answerable request (`ovld agent-session request`) carrying the
  tool/request payload, one of the four request kinds (`permission`,
  `question`, `choice`, `retry`), and a decision window.
- Blocks the harness's tool call until the request is answered, the window
  elapses, or a fallback decision applies — it does not merely publish an
  event and continue.
- Does not leak secrets.
- Degrades gracefully without a web app open: the harness's own fallback
  decision (allow/deny/ask) applies when no one answers in time.

### Stop Hook

Future requirement:

- Checks whether pending delivery is needed after an agent turn.
- Returns a non-blocking delivery status to the connector.

## Setup And Doctor Requirements

`ovld agent-setup <agent>`:

- Detect the agent binary if needed.
- Install or update plugin files.
- Merge user settings safely.
- Write executable hook scripts.
- Write a manifest of managed files.
- Remove Overlord-owned files that are no longer present in the current manifest.
- Be idempotent.

`ovld doctor`:

- Check each supported connector.
- Report installed version/status.
- Detect missing hook executability.
- Detect missing permission rules.
- Detect missing agent binaries.
- Suggest exact repair commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Codex and Claude can both be launched on the same mission objective and receive equivalent protocol instructions.
- Follow-up user messages are recorded without the agent manually retyping them when hooks are installed.
- Setup can be rerun safely.
- Doctor reports missing/stale connector state in a way a user can fix from the CLI.
- Adding a new connector requires a small adapter plus capability metadata, not rewriting protocol rules.
