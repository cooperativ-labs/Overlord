# Agent Protocol

## Goal

Port the `ovld protocol` lifecycle so every agent interacts with Overlord through one stable contract, regardless of connector or UI.

## Design Requirements

- Protocol commands are the authoritative agent interface.
- The same operation should be callable from the CLI, future web API, and future MCP surface.
- Drift between surfaces should be treated as a bug.
- Agents must attach first and deliver last.
- Protocol commands must be safe to call from shell hooks and agent runtimes.
- Protocol commands must handle special characters via `--summary-file -`, `--question-file -`, and `--payload-file -`.

## Required Protocol Commands

### Auth And Project Resolution

For MVP, auth commands can be local no-ops or diagnostics, but command names should be reserved for compatibility.

Requirements:

- `auth-status`: report local runtime readiness and whether an interactive local identity or `USER_TOKEN` is being used, without printing token secrets.
- `discover-project`: resolve project from current working directory, explicit directory, or project identifier. When `.overlord/project.json` lists multiple projects, the result is the `isPrimary` project plus additive `linkedProjects`.
- `list-organizations`: deferred until multi-user/multi-org support; can return the local instance workspace in MVP.

`USER_TOKEN` authentication is a modular expansion feature. When enabled, protocol requests may authenticate with a user-owned token that initially confers all permissions of the creating user. Future token scopes should restrict that user's permissions rather than grant additional access.

### Mission Creation And Discovery

Requirements:

- `create`: create a draft mission/objective without attaching. `--inbox`
  explicitly creates an account-owned unassigned capture; ordinary non-executing
  create uses that fallback only after explicit and discovered project resolution
  fail. `prompt` and `record-work` still require a resolved project.
  `--auto-advance` / `--no-auto-advance` set whether delivery queues the next
  objective (default off). `--objectives-json` items may set per-objective
  `autoAdvance`.
- `prompt`: create a mission and attach or queue execution immediately.
- `load-context`: read mission context without creating a session. Optional
  `--objective-id` returns that objective as the current one instead of
  rediscovering the mission's active objective — required on a mission running
  objectives in parallel, where unpinned rediscovery returns
  `ambiguous_active_objective`.
- `connect`: create a lightweight session key without full context. Optional
  `--objective-id` pins the session to that objective.
- `search` (with `search-missions` retained as an alias): v1 remains compatible. `--response-version 2` returns the
  versioned cross-workspace envelope and accepts stable `--project-id` values,
  `--resource-key`, `--date-field createdAt|updatedAt|dueDatetime`, inclusive `--from`, and
  exclusive `--to`. `--response-version 3` returns `SearchResponseV3` with
  identifiable objective and delivery matches under each mission. The CLI may
  resolve a human project id/slug/name before it calls the service; REST never
  resolves project names. V2 and v3 operate only within one selected
  organization and report applied filters and truncation.
- `discuss-objective`: mark a draft objective submitted. Optional
  `--objective-id` names which draft when a mission holds more than one; the
  objective must be in `draft` state.
- `add-objectives`: append ordered objectives to a mission. Same `autoAdvance`
  JSON field and `--auto-advance` / `--no-auto-advance` default as create.
- `update-objective`: turn auto-advance on or off and/or edit instruction text on draft/future objectives
  (`--objective-id` plus `--auto-advance` or `--no-auto-advance`).
- `record-work`: record already-completed chat work as a review mission with completed objective and delivery record.

### Addressing A Mission Or An Objective

Every subcommand that accepts `--mission-id` also accepts `--objective-id`
(objective UUID or `{mission.display_id}.{display_key}`).

An objective **display** id spells its parent mission — `coo:756.k7xm` contains
`coo:756` — so `--mission-id` may be omitted whenever one is supplied. The
client CLI derives it before sending the request, and the backend derives it
again from the request body, because hosted MCP and direct REST callers never
pass through the CLI. An explicit `--mission-id` always wins and must name that
objective's own mission.

An objective **UUID** names no mission, so `--mission-id` stays required with
one.

```bash
ovld protocol attach --objective-id coo:756.k7xm
ovld protocol update --objective-id coo:756.k7xm --summary "..."
ovld protocol deliver --objective-id coo:756.k7xm --summary "..."
```

This is what makes reconnection work on a mission running more than one
objective: the mission id alone no longer identifies a unit of execution, and
commands that rediscover "the active objective" return
`ambiguous_active_objective` until one is named.

The CLI fills `--objective-id` in from `OVERLORD_OBJECTIVE_ID` (and the
recovered launch bootstrap) on session-scoped subcommands, so an Overlord-launched
agent rarely types it. `update-objective` and `discuss-objective` deliberately
never inherit it: on the first, the id names the row being mutated, and on the
second, the environment points at the executing objective when the command wants
a draft.

The reference grammar lives in `@overlord/contract`
(`parseObjectiveRef`, `formatObjectiveDisplayId`,
`missionDisplayIdFromObjectiveRef`) and is re-exported by `@overlord/database`;
no surface carries a private copy of it.

### Session Lifecycle

Requirements:

- `attach`: start the working session and return full context. Optional `--objective-id` (UUID or `{mission.display_id}.{display_key}`) pins the session to that objective. When `--objective-id` or `--execution-request-id` is present, attach must not rediscover another objective from mission state. `--mission-id` is required only when it cannot be derived (see [Addressing](#addressing-a-mission-or-an-objective)).
- `update`: post progress, discussion/decision events, optional change rationales, and follow-up execution transitions.
- `heartbeat`: update liveness and transient telemetry without creating a mission event.
- `ask`: post a blocking question and stop work.
- `deliver`: finish work, store artifacts/rationales, mark objective complete, and move mission to review.
- `hook-event`: record connector lifecycle events such as `UserPromptSubmit` and future `Stop`. `UserPromptSubmit` records follow-up user activity without requiring a live session and without reopening execution.
- `resume-follow-up`: explicitly reopen a completed objective for post-delivery implementation follow-up, returning a new session key.
- `permission-request`: record that an agent asked for tool permission.

### Shared Context And Attachments

Requirements:

- `read-context`: read persistent shared context.
- `write-context`: write persistent shared context.
- `add-artifact`: create a mission artifact during a turn without delivering
  (same rules as REST `POST /api/missions/:id/artifacts`). Requires `--type`,
  `--label`, and at least one of `--content-text`/`--content-text-file` or
  `--external-url`. Optional `--session-key` stamps session/objective
  provenance; optional `--objective-id` does the same when there is no live
  session, and `--session-key` wins when both are present. Delivery may still
  attach additional artifacts later.
- `update-artifact`: revise an existing mission artifact's label, Markdown
  content, and/or HTTP(S) URL in place (same rules as REST
  `PATCH /api/missions/:id/artifacts/:artifactId`). Requires
  `--expected-revision` for optimistic concurrency; does not require a session
  key so a later objective or follow-up can update an artifact created earlier.
- `attachment-list`: list visible objective attachments.
- `attachment-prepare-upload`: prepare an attachment upload.
- `attachment-finalize-upload`: finalize an uploaded attachment.
- `attachment-download-url`: get a download URL or local file path reference.
- `attachment-upload-file`: one-command local attachment upload.

For the SQLite/local MVP, attachments can use local file storage instead of signed URLs, but keep the command contract compatible.

### Runner, Device, And Project Resource Management

Runner queue/device/project-resource operations are not part of the agent
protocol. They are management surfaces:

- `ovld runner once|start|status|clear|clear-all` uses `/api/runner/*` REST
  endpoints to claim and update execution requests.
- `ovld create-project` and `ovld add-cwd` use project REST endpoints to create
  projects and register checkout paths.

Agents should treat objective execution as: attach to a mission, report progress,
ask when blocked, and deliver. They should not claim queue work through
`ovld protocol`.

## Attach Response Requirements

`attach`, `connect`, and `prompt` should accept optional native session
attribution with `external-session-id`. When the flag is omitted, the CLI may
auto-detect known agent session IDs from harness environment variables or
connector hook caches and store the result in `agent_sessions.external_session_id`.
Runner-launched agents may also carry `OVERLORD_EXECUTION_REQUEST_ID` and
`OVERLORD_OBJECTIVE_ID`; the CLI forwards them as `--execution-request-id` and
`--objective-id` during `attach` so the backend pins that objective and can link
`execution_requests.launched_session_id` to the created session. When either pin
is present, attach must not rediscover another objective from mission state.
`attach` and `load-context` also accept optional `executionTargetId`; the CLI
uses it when it knows the local execution target so context assembly can resolve
project resource paths for that target. This is additive and may be omitted.

`attach` must return:

- Mission metadata.
- Current objective metadata, including objective ID, instruction text, and
  optional `resourceKey`.
- All objective IDs, states, and optional `resourceKey` values in order.
- Session object with `sessionKey`.
- History/events relevant to the mission.
- Artifacts.
- Attachments visible to the active objective.
- Shared context.
- `projectResources` when available: the project's logical resources resolved
  for the relevant execution target.
- Concise `agentInstructions` with workflow guidance and pointers to structured fields.
- Pending objective information when relevant.

`projectResources` entries have this shape:

```ts
{
  resourceKey: string;
  label: string | null;
  isPrimary: boolean;
  isCurrent: boolean;
  path: string | null;
  state: string;
}
```

`path` is absolute on the session's execution target when known, and null when
the target is unknown or has no row for that logical resource. `state` mirrors
the latest target resource observation for that row, or `unknown`.

The agent instructions should include:

- Mission ID.
- Objective ID.
- Objective title or fallback label.
- Project identifier/name.
- Where to find the objective body and related context in the structured JSON.
- Required protocol workflow instructions.
- A `Project Resources` section when the project spans multiple logical
  resources. It identifies the current resource and sibling resources available
  on the same execution target, and instructs agents to treat siblings as
  read-only context unless a future objective launches in that resource.

## Update Requirements

`update` fields:

- `session-key`
- `mission-id`
- `summary` or `summary-file`
- `phase`
- `event-type`
- `payload-json`
- `external-url`
- `external-session-id`
- `begin-follow-up-work`
- `follow-up-intent`
- `track-changed-files`
- `changed-files-json` or `changed-files-file`
- `change-rationales-json` or `change-rationales-file`

Post-delivery discussion vs execution:

- Connector `UserPromptSubmit` hooks should call `hook-event` for ordinary user
  follow-up messages. This appends `user_follow_up` activity and does not change
  objective state.
- When the user explicitly asks for more implementation after delivery, agents
  should call `resume-follow-up` to create a new live session and transition the
  completed objective to `pending_delivery`.
- A bare `attach` must not silently reopen a completed objective.
- `resume-follow-up` reuses the existing completed objective rather than adding
  a new objective when the user is asking for a correction or update to the
  delivered work.

Changed-file tracking requirements:

- Changed-file capture is mechanical, not agent-enumerated. The client CLI records a VCS baseline (changed file paths from local `git status`) for the working directory when a work session begins (`attach`, and `resume-follow-up`), and at `deliver` computes the run-attributable delta — the paths changed now minus the baseline — and sends them as changed files. Agents do not have to manually list what they changed.
- VCS is read on the client only. The CLI sends normalized file paths/statuses (never full diffs or file contents); the backend persists what the client sends.
- Capture is best-effort: outside a git repository, or when git is unavailable, no changed files are inferred and delivery proceeds on whatever the agent recorded explicitly.
- `update` may still carry explicit changed-file metadata (`--changed-files-json` / `--changed-files-file`) during normal progress updates, without requiring extra agent calls.
- Agents may include rationale fields for changed files in the same update payload when useful, but incomplete rationales are allowed before delivery.
- Changed files are upserted by session, objective, and normalized file path so repeated updates revise the same file record instead of creating duplicates.
- Changed-file records should distinguish mechanically observed file changes from agent-authored rationales.
- Files that can no longer be observed in the local diff should not be silently deleted from history; they should be marked resolved/no-current-diff or excluded from final coverage according to review rules.

> Concurrency note: the baseline-at-attach / delta-at-deliver approach subtracts
> files that were already dirty when the session began. Worktree isolation and
> objective resource binding improve attribution for launched sessions, but agents
> must still avoid editing sibling resources exposed only for context because those
> paths are outside the session's resolved working directory.

Supported phases:

- `draft`
- `execute`
- `review`
- `deliver`
- `complete`
- `blocked`
- `cancelled`

Supported event types:

- `update`
- `user_follow_up`
- `alert`
- `discussion_summary`
- `decision`

## Delivery Requirements

`deliver` must support:

- `summary`
- `artifacts`
- `changeRationales`
- `changed-files-json` / `changed-files-file` (normally auto-injected by the CLI from the run-attributable VCS delta; each entry may carry an optional `attribution` of `mine`/`claimed`/`unclaimed` and `claimedByMissionIds`, computed client-side and never persisted — used only to enrich a `missing_rationale` error)
- `observed-dirty-paths-json` (optional; the full current dirty worktree, auto-injected by the CLI — see **Server-Side Reconciliation** below)
- `no-file-changes` (assert this run changed no files; skips rationale-coverage enforcement)
- `skip-rationale-for-json` / `skip-rationale-for-file` (per-file rationale overrides for changes the agent did not make)
- `payload-json`
- `payload-file`
- `payload-json.deliveryReport` / `payload-file.deliveryReport` (optional versioned agent evidence)
- optional file-change coverage checks

Delivery rules:

- Every meaningful tracked file change should have a rationale.
- Do not store generic `file_changes` artifacts as a substitute for structured rationales.
- Delivery validates rationale coverage against the changed-file records for the objective (aggregated across all sessions and no-session `record-work` records). The client supplies the current run's changed files from local VCS; the agent can pass `--no-file-changes` to declare the run made no file changes, or `--skip-rationale-for-json` / `--skip-rationale-for-file` to override rationale requirements for specific paths the agent did not change (each entry requires `file_path` and `reason`).
- Delivery is the final review boundary, but it should not be the first time Overlord learns which files changed during the session.
- Delivery moves the active objective to `complete`.
- Delivery moves the mission to review unless another explicit status is requested later.
- Delivery may trigger auto-advance for the next objective.
- After delivery, implementation work must not continue until follow-up execution is explicitly started.
- `payload-json` / `payload-file` may include `deliveryReport: { schemaVersion: 1, agentReport }`.
  `agentReport` accepts `humanActions`, `tradeoffsMade`, `knownRisks`, `deferredWork`,
  and `assumptions`; each missing array becomes `[]`. Human actions are for concrete
  work outside the agent's completed changes and must never include Git actions or
  routine review/testing. The protocol stores a deterministic presentation immediately;
  delivery does not wait for an AI provider.

### Server-Side Reconciliation And Self-Servicing Errors

- `deliver` accepts an optional `observedDirtyPaths` (every path the client currently observes as dirty — the full worktree, not just the run-attributable delta). When present, `changed_files` rows for the objective that are `present` but whose path is absent from `observedDirtyPaths` are reconciled to `current_diff_state = 'resolved'` before rationale coverage is computed. This un-poisons coverage from a past over-attribution (e.g. a file recorded while an edit hook was inert and never dirty again) instead of permanently demanding a rationale for it. Omitting the field skips reconciliation (older clients behave exactly as before).
- A `resolved` row is excluded from rationale-coverage enforcement and is reported in review as coverage state `resolved`, distinct from `covered`, `missing_rationale`, `skipped`, and `unassigned`.
- A `missing_rationale` failure carries a structured `details.missingRationales` array, one entry per outstanding path: `{ filePath, classification: 'mine' | 'claimed' | 'unclaimed', suggestedSkip: { filePath, reason } | null }`. `suggestedSkip` is `null` for `'mine'` (a real rationale is owed, not a skip) and a ready-to-use `--skip-rationale-for-json` entry otherwise, so a rejected `deliver` needs exactly one mechanical retry instead of an investigation. Classification comes from the `attribution` the client attached to each `changed-files-json` entry.
- `ovld protocol changes --mission-id <id>` (or `--objective-id <display id>`) is a local-only, read-only preflight (no backend call) that prints this same mine/claimed/unclaimed classification plus draft rationales ahead of time, so an agent never has to hand-triage `git status` before delivering.

## Record-Work Requirements

`record-work` exists for work already completed in the current chat without an attached session.

Requirements:

- Create a mission directly in review.
- Create a completed objective.
- Store a delivery summary.
- Store artifacts and change rationales if provided.
- Record a `changed_files` row for every rationale's file path (shown "covered" in review) plus any explicit `--changed-files-json` entries (shown "missing_rationale"), so the review file panel matches a normal delivery.
- Store delivery and changed-file records without requiring an `agent_sessions` row; session attribution is null for `record-work`.
- Enqueue the standard delivery compose job so the Gemini delivery summary runs exactly as it does for a normal `deliver`.
- Accept the whole submission as a single `--payload-json` / `--payload-file` envelope (`{ objective, summary, title, changeRationales, changedFiles, artifacts }`), with explicit flags overriding envelope fields.
- Do not use it for in-progress work.

The exact submission format is documented in the shared connector reference at
`connectors/core/overlord-mission/reference/record-work.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agents can complete the full lifecycle using only `ovld protocol`.
- `attach` gives enough context for a new agent session to continue work without reading prior chat.
- Follow-up messages from hooks are preserved as events.
- Delivery with missing required rationale fields fails with a useful error.
- Protocol payloads can be sent via stdin to avoid shell quoting failures.
- Local MVP command names remain compatible with future HTTP/MCP surfaces.
