# Desktop App — Behavior Spec

The behavior reference for the `desktop` contract component. The planning
rationale lives in
[`planning/feature-plans/desktop-app-module.md`](../../planning/feature-plans/desktop-app-module.md)
and
[`planning/feature-plans/desktop-app-packaging.md`](../../planning/feature-plans/desktop-app-packaging.md);
this document records what shipped.

## 1. What it is

An optional Electron shell that wraps the existing webapp. It owns the native app
shell and process supervision only — never product logic, REST/DTO shapes,
CLI/terminal config, the auth mechanism, or the DB schema (those belong to the
`rest`, `cli`/`runner`, `auth`, and `database` components respectively).

## 2. Window & security baseline

- A single `BrowserWindow` with `contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`,
  `nodeIntegration: false`, `webSecurity: true`, `spellcheck: true`, and a
  `preload` exposed through `contextBridge`. These are non-negotiable.
- A loopback-scoped **CSP** applied via `session.webRequest.onHeadersReceived`:
  `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'`, inline styles allowed,
  `connect-src 'self'` + the loopback `http`/`ws` origin, `object-src 'none'`,
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`. No remote origins (there is no Supabase/remote API).
- A **single-instance lock**: a second launch focuses the existing window.
- **External-navigation handling**: `will-navigate` and `setWindowOpenHandler`
  send any off-origin URL to the system browser; in-app navigation stays on the
  loopback origin.

### Title bar & native chrome (macOS)

On macOS the native title bar is removed (`titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'`) and the
traffic lights are inset at `{ x: 14, y: 14 }`, so the webapp's own top nav is the
title bar — there is no separate "Overlord" chrome strip above the UI. The SPA
_feature-detects_ the shell (`window.overlord`) to make the nav header / sidebar
header a window-drag region (`-webkit-app-region`) and to reserve room under the
inset lights; in a browser those styles are inert. This stays within the shell's
ownership of the window baseline and uses only the existing `window.overlord`
bridge — it does not fork or modify the SPA.

The macOS window also sets `vibrancy: 'sidebar'` with a transparent
`backgroundColor` so the left sidebar column can show the native sidebar material.
The SPA sets `data-mac-desktop` on `<html>` and makes only `[data-slot="sidebar-inner"]`
transparent; main content (`SidebarInset`, setup/auth screens) stays opaque.
Vibrancy follows Electron `nativeTheme`, which the SPA keeps in sync with its
`overlord-theme` preference via `window.overlord.setNativeThemeSource()` so the
sidebar material respects the app's light/dark/system toggle (not just the OS
appearance).

A **native context menu** is registered on the renderer's `context-menu` event
(`registerNativeContextMenu`). Because the renderer is sandboxed with no Node
access, the shell supplies the OS-native menu: in editable fields it offers
spellcheck suggestions (from `spellcheck: true`) plus undo/redo/cut/copy/paste/
select-all; over a plain text selection it offers copy/select-all; elsewhere it
stays out of the way.

## 3. Process lifecycle

1. On `app.whenReady`, claim a free loopback port (starting at `web_port`,
   default 4310).
2. Show a splash window (`splash.html`).
3. Activate the **active backend profile** (`activateBackendProfile` in
   `backend-lifecycle.ts` — the single decision point for which local processes
   a profile may run):
   - **Local:** reap any prior backend, then fork the bundled server
     (`backend/dist-server/index.cjs`) inside an Electron **`utilityProcess`**
     with `OVERLORD_WEB_HOST`/`OVERLORD_WEB_PORT`/`OVERLORD_WEBAPP_DIST` set and
     SQL Studio disabled. Exactly one backend process exists afterwards.
   - **Remote:** reap any prior backend and **never fork one**; serve the
     bundled SPA shell from the in-process static server and health-check the
     hosted backend over HTTPS. Activation fails loudly if a backend is somehow
     still running, so a Remote session can never retain the local Node/REST
     backend or its SQLite runtime.
4. Poll `GET /api/health` until ready (30s budget), then load
   `http://<host>:<port>/`. On failure, show a Retry / (Switch to Local) / Quit
   dialog; every recovery path relaunches the app rather than re-entering boot
   in a process that already owns servers and IPC handlers.
5. On `before-quit`, the quit is held until the backend process has actually
   exited (SIGTERM, escalating to SIGKILL) — a kill is never fired into a race
   with teardown. Closing the main window leaves the shell running when its
   hidden Quick Task window is present; activating the app or launching it again
   restores or recreates the main window. Quitting the app stops the server.

`server.ts` supervises the backend through `backend-process.ts`, which
guarantees at most one live process, binds each `exit` listener to its own
child (a late exit from a replaced process can never orphan the current one),
and makes `stopServer()` resolve only once the process is reaped.

The server is the **same bundle** `ovld serve` runs. Using a `utilityProcess`
(rather than a separate Node binary) means a single runtime is shipped, signed,
and notarized; `better-sqlite3` is rebuilt once for the Electron ABI.

### Connect-only dev mode

With `OVERLORD_DESKTOP_DEV=1` the shell does **not** fork a server; it connects
to an already-running one (`OVERLORD_DESKTOP_URL`, default
`http://127.0.0.1:4310`). This keeps the dev loop free of an Electron-ABI native
rebuild.

## 4. Database sharing

The embedded server is started with **no** `OVERLORD_SQLITE_PATH`, so it uses the
per-user global default (`~/.ovld/Overlord.sqlite`). Any `ovld` invoked from a
terminal uses the same default, so a launched agent's `ovld protocol
attach/update/deliver` shows up live in the window via the SSE feed — with no
"Install CLI" step required for the common single-machine case. The server boot
path **creates and migrates** the database on first run.

> Set `OVERLORD_SQLITE_PATH` in the environment to point the shell at an isolated
> app-data database instead; storage follows the database location automatically
> (`fixupLocalStoragePaths`).

## 5. The `window.overlord` bridge

A minimal, audited surface the SPA **feature-detects** (`if (window.overlord)`):

No tokens, Node access, or product logic cross this boundary.

### Mission deep links

The shell owns `overlord://missions/<missionId>` mission links. It accepts only ids
matching `[A-Za-z0-9:_-]{1,64}`, focuses or creates the main window, and forwards the
fixed internal `/user/missions/<missionId>` route through `onNavigate`. The custom URL
and the preload notification carry no credentials, OAuth ticket, or other payload.

### Backend profiles and CLI auth

The shell can switch between a **local** embedded backend and one or more
**remote** cloud backends (Settings → Backend). Each profile uses a separate
Electron session partition.

**Switching restarts the app.** Local mode owns a forked web/REST server, a
SQLite runtime, and a loopback origin; Remote mode owns none of them. Rather
than hot-swapping the two runtimes in a live process, `switchToProfile`
persists the chosen profile, reaps every process the outgoing profile owns, and
relaunches — so the incoming profile always boots from zero supervised
processes. A profile that cannot be reached on that first boot after a switch
clears its stored session and offers a fall-back to Local.

- **Local profile:** signing in mirrors the session bearer into
  `~/.ovld/auth.json` so the CLI can reuse the same credentials. On startup (or
  when switching back to Local), the shell imports a matching `auth.json` session
  if the desktop profile has no saved token yet.
- **Remote profiles:** tokens stay in the desktop shell's encrypted store only.
  The CLI must authenticate separately with `ovld auth login` or a USER_TOKEN
  after `ovld config set cloud <url>`.
- **GitHub sign-in on remote profiles:** the shell opens OAuth in the system
  browser. Once Better Auth has created the browser session, the backend sends
  an opaque, one-time `overlord://auth/callback` ticket to Electron. Electron
  exchanges that ticket directly with the active backend and saves the session
  token in the profile's encrypted store; no session or GitHub token appears in
  the deep link or crosses the preload bridge.
- **Config sync:** switching backends updates `~/.ovld/overlord.toml`
  (`backend_url`, `backend_mode`). That does not change CLI auth — run
  `ovld auth status` after a backend switch to verify URL and login state.

## 6.1 Quick task window

The desktop shell registers a global shortcut (default **Cmd+Shift+O** on macOS,
**Ctrl+Shift+O** elsewhere) that toggles a small always-on-top frameless window
loading `/quick-task` on the loopback origin. The SPA route renders
`QuickTaskBar`: a compact objective composer with project picker, agent/model
selection, optional attachments, and Enter / Cmd+Enter submit semantics. Window
position and hotkey preference persist in the shell's `settings.json` under the
app user-data directory.

## 6.0 Process diagnostics

Every Electron child is named `Overlord Helper` on macOS, so identifying which
one is the embedded backend needs more than Activity Monitor.

- **From inside the app:** `process-inventory.ts` records `app.getAppMetrics()`
  (pid, process type, `serviceName` — the backend's is `overlord-server` — and
  working-set size) at boot, before a profile switch, and before quit. Snapshots
  are printed to stderr and appended as JSON lines to
  `<userData>/diagnostics/process-inventory.jsonl`, so a before/after comparison
  survives the relaunch a profile switch performs.
- **From outside:** `node desktop/scripts/desktop-process-report.mjs` reads the
  real command lines out of `ps`, classifies each process (main / renderer / gpu
  / utility / **embedded-backend**), and reports RSS per process plus a count of
  embedded backends. `--json`, `--label <name> --out <file>` and
  `--ps-file <capture>` make before/after measurements repeatable.

A Remote profile is conformant when both report **zero** embedded backend
processes.

## 6. Updates

The shell uses `electron-updater` for packaged-app updates. On startup it checks
the configured feed, then checks again every four hours. Updates download
automatically; installation is explicit through **Settings → Desktop** or the
native **Check for Updates...** / **Install Update and Relaunch** menu items.

Release builds can embed a generic update feed by setting
`OVERLORD_UPDATE_FEED_URL` when running `yarn desktop:package:prod`. The default feed
is [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cooperativ-labs/OpenOverlord/releases/latest/download/)
(see `desktop/update-feed.ts`). Each release must publish the `.zip`, `.blockmap`,
and `latest-mac.yml` files emitted by electron-builder — `yarn desktop:publish`
uploads them automatically. In unsigned/dev builds without a feed, update checks
report as unavailable.

## 6.2 CLI updates

The shell checks whether the installed `ovld` CLI is behind the latest published
npm version on startup and every four hours, using `ovld update --check --json`.
It prefers the `ovld` binary on `PATH` (what terminal sessions use) and falls
back to the bundled CLI entry when packaged. When an update is available, the
SPA surfaces an in-app system notification with an **Update now** action (runs
`ovld update` in the main process) and a copyable `ovld update` command as a
fallback.

## 7. Launching agents

Launching is unchanged: the webapp's **Launch** button queues an
`execution_request`; an `ovld runner` claims it and `ovld launch` opens the agent
in the terminal profile stored on the local execution target (CLI-owned). The desktop may
supervise a runner so the button works with zero manual setup. The shell adds no
terminal configuration of its own.

## 8. Packaging

`scripts/build-desktop.ts` (`yarn desktop:package:prod`) stages the server bundle, SPA,
CLI, and a runtime-only `.env.prod`, then runs electron-builder:

- Targets: `dmg` + `zip` (mac, arm64 + x64), `AppImage` + `deb` (linux).
- Before electron-builder runs, the script deletes and recreates `desktop/release`
  so each package build starts from a clean release directory.
- `appId: io.cooperativ.openoverlord` (the stable macOS update identity), hardened runtime + entitlements
  (`build/entitlements.mac.plist`), no App Sandbox (the app spawns agents and
  reads repos).
- `better-sqlite3` is rebuilt for the Electron ABI and `asarUnpack`'d alongside
  `@overlord/database` (its SQL migrations are read from disk).
- Code signing uses the Developer ID Application identity (auto-discovered or
  `CSC_LINK`); notarization (`--notarize`) uses `APPLE_ID` /
  `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` / `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. `--no-sign` produces an ad-hoc
  build.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` is required for `desktop:package:prod` so packaged builds
  ship with a default Gemini key, but the staged `.env.prod` is filtered to
  runtime keys only and excludes build-only secrets such as `APPLE_*`.
- `OVERLORD_UPDATE_FEED_URL` overrides the default GitHub Releases updater feed
  (`desktop/update-feed.ts`) and causes electron-builder to emit update metadata
  such as `latest-mac.yml`.

### Native module / toolchain notes

`better-sqlite3` is rebuilt for the Electron ABI by `@electron/rebuild` during
packaging, so the build machine needs:

- **`better-sqlite3` ≥ 12.10.1** — earlier 12.x releases fail to compile against
  Electron 42's V8 (`v8::External::New` gained a required third argument). 12.10.1
  builds against Electron 42 cleanly.
- **A node-gyp-compatible Python** — node-gyp's bundled gyp imports `distutils`,
  which was removed in Python 3.12. `yarn desktop:package:prod` uses `PYTHON` when
  set, otherwise it auto-selects an installed `python3.11`/`python3.10`/`python3.9`
  /`python3.8` if the default Python cannot import `distutils`. If none is
  available, install Python 3.11 or `pip install setuptools` for the default
  Python.
- Xcode Command Line Tools (the C++ toolchain) for the compile.

A verified `--no-sign` arm64 + x64 build with Electron 42.4.0 produces
`Overlord-<version>-arm64.dmg` / `Overlord-<version>.dmg` (and matching `.zip`s).

## 9. Deferred (later phases)

- "Install CLI" shim, Tailscale, feed window, connector/plugin auto-install.
  These remain CLI surfaces or future work.
