# Overlord Cloud backend image (Railway).
#
# Builds the bundled web/REST/protocol/runner/realtime server
# (`backend/dist-server/index.cjs`, produced by `backend/scripts/build-server.mjs
# --cloud`) and runs it on plain Node. This is the always-on control-plane
# service from `planning/feature-plans/overlord-cloud-architecture.md`: it owns
# auth, the execution-request queue, protocol writeback, and the realtime feed,
# and it reaches Neon Postgres over the injected `DATABASE_URL`.
#
# The cloud server bundle keeps `@google/genai` external (see build-server.mjs).
# `better-sqlite3` is lazy-loaded only on the Local SQLite path and is not
# installed in this image. The SPA is served from Vercel, not this container
# (`OVERLORD_SERVE_SPA=false`). `nodeLinker: node-modules` (see .yarnrc.yml)
# makes the externals available at runtime.
#
# See private-docs/deployment-overlord-cloud.md for the operator runbook.
