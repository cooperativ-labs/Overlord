# Objective Manager: Objective Lifecycle Within a Mission

This document specifies how objectives behave within a mission: which states exist,
what triggers every state transition, and the invariants the system enforces at all
times. It is written as a portable, implementation-agnostic specification so the
behavior can be replicated on any storage layer or runtime.

It complements, and must stay consistent with:

- [`cli/docs/06-core-domain-and-lifecycle.md`](../../../cli/docs/06-core-domain-and-lifecycle.md) — domain concepts and required states.
- [`cli/docs/03-agent-protocol.md`](../../../cli/docs/03-agent-protocol.md) — the protocol verbs that drive transitions.
- [`cli/docs/04-runner-and-launch-execution.md`](../../../cli/docs/04-runner-and-launch-execution.md) — the execution-request queue and runner.
- [`database/docs/09-database-schema-contract.md`](../../../database/docs/09-database-schema-contract.md) — the `objectives` and `execution_requests` tables.

Per `CONTRACT.md`, the database layer owns the schema and constraints, the protocol
layer owns the transition-triggering verbs, and the CLI/runner owns launch execution.
This document is the cross-cutting behavioral specification those layers implement
together; it does not change any stable interface.

> **Divergence from upstream:** this specification deliberately omits upstream
> Overlord's `submitted` state (see [Section 10](#10-suggested-simplifications-vs-the-upstream-design),
> item 4). Discussion does not change objective state; `launching` covers the entire
> "execution ordered, agent not yet attached" window. The reference specs listed
> above still include `submitted` and the `discuss-objective` transition — adopting
> this simplification requires updating them and the schema contract's state
> vocabulary together.

## Concepts

A **mission** represents a whole feature or goal. Each mission owns an ordered queue of
**objectives** — one objective equals one agent prompt/work session. Objectives advance
through a state machine driven by three kinds of triggers:

1. **User actions** — run, reorder, promote, edit, complete, revert.
2. **Agent protocol calls** — `attach`, `update`, `deliver`.
3. **Background automation** — auto-advance after delivery, queue refill, launch settlement.

Two of these automations are connected but distinct, and must never be conflated:

- **Queue refill (`ensureDraftSlot`) is unconditional.** Whenever the "next up"
  objective leaves the editable queue (attaches, is completed, or is demoted to
  `future`), the next `future` objective becomes `draft` — or a blank draft is
  created. This happens regardless of any preference and can be triggered by user
  actions or by automation.
- **Auto-advance is opt-in policy.** A draft launching automatically after a delivery
  happens only when the user enabled `auto_advance` on that objective. Auto-advance
  _requests_ transitions; it never contains refill logic of its own.

## 1. State catalog

`objectives.state` has six values:

| State              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Instruction text may be empty? |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `future`           | Queued behind the current draft; not yet next in line.                                                                                                                                                                | Yes                            |
| `draft`            | The single editable "next up" objective for the mission.                                                                                                                                                               | Yes                            |
| `launching`        | A launch has been requested (an execution request exists) but no agent has attached yet. Covers the whole pre-attach window. Still a kind of draft: editable and re-queueable, and still the mission's "next up" slot. | No                             |
| `executing`        | An agent session is attached and actively working the objective.                                                                                                                                                      | No                             |
| `pending_delivery` | Follow-up execution after a prior delivery produced new work that needs a re-delivery.                                                                                                                                | No                             |
| `complete`         | Done. `completed_at` is set.                                                                                                                                                                                          | No                             |

Conceptually there are three groups:

- **Queue states** — `future`, `draft`, and `launching`: the editable "next up" line.
  `launching` straddles the boundary — it has been handed to the launch pipeline, but
  it remains editable and re-queueable and still occupies the next-up slot until an
  agent actually attaches.
- **Active states** — `executing`, `pending_delivery`: an agent has the objective.
- **Terminal state** — `complete`. Re-enterable: a user may revert a completed
  objective to `draft`, and follow-up work may pull it back into the active set as
  `pending_delivery`.

Two derived state sets are used throughout the rules below:

- **Launchable** (an execution request may be created or claimed for the objective):
  `draft`, `launching`.
- **Active for queue-insertion purposes** (used to decide whether a newly added
  objective becomes `draft` or `future`): `draft`, `launching`, `executing`,
  `pending_delivery`.

> Naming note: `objectives.state = 'launching'` and
> `execution_requests.status = 'launching'` are **different fields with different
> lifespans**. The objective state covers the entire request-created → attach window;
> the request status only covers the post-spawn/pre-attach window. See
> [Section 7](#7-companion-state-machine-execution-requests).

## 2. State diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft : created as next-up (no active objective on mission)
    [*] --> future : created while another objective is active

    future --> draft : queue refill (lowest position)<br/>or user "promote" action
    draft --> future : demoted when another objective becomes draft

    draft --> launching : launch requested<br/>(manual run, API, auto-advance)
    launching --> draft : launch-queue creation failure revert

    draft --> executing : agent attaches (fallback)
    launching --> executing : agent attaches

    executing --> complete : deliver / complete-type phase / manual check-off
    executing --> pending_delivery : meaningful follow-up work<br/>after a prior delivery
    complete --> pending_delivery : follow-up work on a delivered objective
    pending_delivery --> complete : re-deliver

    complete --> draft : user reverts (mark draft)
    future --> [*] : user deletes / blank body cleared
```

Discussion is intentionally absent from this diagram: an agent opening or discussing
a mission without an execution order does **not** change objective state. The draft
stays `draft`. Only an explicit execution order (launch request or attach) moves an
objective forward.

---

## 3. Required invariants

These rules must hold at all times, regardless of which code path writes. Enforce them
**transactionally in the storage layer where the database can express them** (unique
partial indexes, check constraints, triggers); where it cannot, the service layer must
enforce them and the adapter conformance suite must test that enforcement.

1. **At most one `draft` per mission.**
2. **At most one `executing` _or_ `pending_delivery` objective per mission, unless
   `missions.allow_parallel_objectives` is true.** The default remains serial so
   auto-advance races cannot leave two objectives active on the same checkout.
   When the flag is on, several active objectives are allowed on any resource,
   including the same one. Checkout safety moves to the Runner Layer: a mission that
   uses worktrees puts a concurrently launched same-resource objective on its own
   branch (`<mission branch>-<objectives.display_key>`) in its own worktree, and a
   mission that runs without worktrees has one checkout that both objectives share
   deliberately — file attribution then comes only from each explicitly bound
   objective/session ledger, never from a checkout-wide scan.
3. **Unique per-mission positions.** `position` is an integer, unique per mission,
   0-based.
4. **Auto-assigned position on insert.** When a caller omits `position`, the system
   assigns `max(position) + 1` for the mission. Callers doing manual reorders set
   positions explicitly.
5. **Non-empty instruction text in `launching` and beyond.** An objective can never
   enter `launching`, `executing`, `pending_delivery`, or `complete` with blank
   instruction text. (Blank text is allowed only in `future` and `draft`.)
6. **`completed_at` is system-managed.** Entering `complete` stamps
   `completed_at = now()` (if not provided); moving to any non-`complete` state
   clears it.
7. **At most one active agent session per objective.** A new attach must first detach
   any prior active session for the objective.
8. **At most one in-flight execution request per objective.** All launch paths reuse
   or re-queue an existing active request instead of inserting duplicates.
9. **`auto_advance` defaults to `false`.** Auto-advance is explicit opt-in per
   objective.
10. **CAS-guarded transitions.** Every state change is guarded on the expected current
    state (compare-and-swap on `state`), so concurrent triggers degrade to no-ops,
    never to duplicate transitions.

---

## 4. Ordering rules and the position queue

- **Canonical sort order is `position ASC`, tie-broken by `created_at ASC`.** Every
  "pick the next objective" query in the system uses this order
  (`sortObjectivesByLifecycleOrder`).
- **Display order is not the position queue.** Once objectives can run out of
  order — parallel objectives, run queues, ad-hoc launches — position no longer
  describes what happened, so a mission's objective list
  (`sortObjectivesForMissionDisplay`) reads as history followed by plan:
  1. `complete`, oldest `completed_at` first;
  2. `executing` / `pending_delivery`, oldest `started_at` first;
  3. `launching`, oldest `launched_at` first;
  4. `draft` / `submitted`, then `future`, in position order.

  Each group sorts by its own recorded moment; a missing moment (rows written
  before the timestamps existed) falls back to position, so an untimestamped
  mission renders exactly as it did before. Only groups 4 are position-ordered,
  which is why drag-to-reorder covers `future` alone. Planning and dispatch
  (`planEnsureDraftSlot`, `decideAutoAdvanceAfterDelivery`, run-queue dispatch)
  keep using the position order — display order is presentation only.
- **Lifecycle timestamps.** `objectives.launched_at` and `objectives.started_at`
  are stamped first-wins (`COALESCE`) on entry to `launching` and `executing`;
  `completed_at` is written on delivery. First-wins matters: re-launching, or
  re-attaching for follow-up work after a delivery, must not move an objective
  that already earned its place in the list.
- **Appending** (protocol `create`, `add-objectives`, UI "add objective"): new rows
  take `max(position) + 1` per insert order. An inserted objective becomes `draft`
  only when the mission currently has **no existing `draft` objective**. Once a draft
  exists, every additional inserted objective is created as `future`. In a creation
  batch, this means the first objective for a new mission is `draft` and all remaining
  objectives are `future`.
- **User reorder** (drag-and-drop or equivalent):
  - Only the **`draft` + `future`** set can be reordered. IDs outside that set are
    silently dropped from the request.
  - The reordered queue **recycles the same sorted position pool** the set already
    occupied, so reordering never collides with positions held by
    launching/executing/complete objectives.
  - Persistence must satisfy the unique-position invariant mid-write — for example a
    two-phase write (move affected rows to temporary high positions, then write final
    positions) or a single transaction with deferred constraint checking.
- **Promotion**: promoting a `future` objective to `draft` splices it into the current
  draft's slot in the ordering, demotes any existing `draft` to `future` first
  (preserving invariant #1), then persists positions.
- **Deletion**: only `future` objectives may be deleted outright. Clearing the
  instruction text of a `future` objective through the editor also deletes it.
  Positions are _not_ compacted on delete; uniqueness and relative order are
  sufficient.
- **Editing**: instruction text is only editable in `draft`, `future`, and
  `launching` (a launching objective is still a draft in spirit — editable and
  re-queueable until an agent attaches). Text in `executing`, `pending_delivery`,
  and `complete` is immutable through editing surfaces.

## 5. Transition reference

Every transition, its trigger, guard conditions, and side effects.

### 5.1 Creation

| Trigger                                                | Resulting state                                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mission created with objectives (protocol `create`, UI) | First objective `draft`, rest `future`                                             | A create-and-run variant (e.g. `prompt`) additionally requests execution immediately.                                                             |
| `add-objectives` protocol call                         | Each appended objective is `draft` only if no draft exists yet; otherwise `future` | This preserves the one-draft invariant across repeated additions.                                                                                 |
| UI "add objective"                                     | `draft` if the mission has no draft yet, else `future`                              | No-op if the last editable objective is already an empty draft. New row inherits `assigned_agent` from the most recently set agent on the mission. |
| Automatic queue refill (5.3 step 5 / 5.4)              | `draft`                                                                            | Promote next `future`, or insert an **empty draft** when no `future` exists.                                                                      |

### 5.2 Discussion — no state change

An agent opening or discussing a mission without an execution order leaves the
objective in `draft`. There is no discussion state and no session is created.
**Discussion ≠ execution**: only an explicit execution order (a launch request, 5.3,
or an attach, 5.4) moves an objective out of `draft`.

> Upstream Overlord models discussion as a `draft → submitted` transition via a
> `discuss-objective` verb. This specification drops that state; if the verb is kept
> for protocol compatibility, it validates that the draft has non-empty instruction
> text and is otherwise a state no-op. Upstream `submitted` data maps to `draft` here.

### 5.3 `draft` → `launching` — launch requested

**Trigger:** an execution request is created for the objective. Sources
(`requested_source`): a user manually running the objective, the public API/CLI, or
auto-advance after a delivery (see 5.6).

Sequence (all steps guarded so races cannot double-queue):

1. Resolve the target objective: the explicit objective ID, or the
   **lowest-position launchable** (`draft`/`launching`) objective on the mission.
   Reject if instruction text is empty, the state is not launchable, or the mission is
   marked human-only.
2. **Dedup:** if an active (`queued`/`claimed`/`launching`) execution request already
   exists for the objective, reuse it — a stale `claimed`/`launching` request is
   CAS-reset to `queued` and a fresh `execution_requested` event is emitted so runners
   wake up. No new request, no objective-state change beyond what already happened.
3. If the objective is `draft`, update it to `launching` (CAS-guarded on
   `state = 'draft'`). Auto-advance also stamps `auto_advanced_at`. (A `launching`
   objective stays `launching`.)
4. Insert the execution request with `status = 'queued'` and an idempotency key
   (`auto_advance:<objective_id>` for auto-advance; unique otherwise). A uniqueness
   violation on insert is resolved by reusing the request that won the race.
5. Emit an `execution_requested` mission event (this is what wakes runners).

**No queue refill here.** The launching objective is still the mission's editable
"next up" slot (it can be edited and re-queued until attach), so `draft → launching`
does not trigger `ensureDraftSlot`. The refill happens at attach (5.4).

**Failure revert:** if the request cannot be created (insert error, unresolvable
race), revert the objective `launching` → `draft` (CAS-guarded on
`state = 'launching'`) and clear `auto_advanced_at`. This is the only automated
backward transition out of `launching`.

### 5.4 `launching`/`draft` → `executing` — agent attaches

**Trigger:** an agent calls `attach` (or an attach-equivalent verb such as
`connect`/`spawn` that shares the same transition logic).

1. **Selection order:** prefer the lowest-position objective in `launching`, then
   `draft` (each in canonical order). The first non-empty match is the launch
   objective.
2. **Re-attach idempotency:** when no launchable objective exists but the mission
   already has an `executing` or `pending_delivery` objective, attach returns that
   objective **without changing state**. This lets an agent that lost its session key
   recover by re-attaching.
3. Guard: an assigned agent must resolve from the objective (or attach metadata);
   attach fails otherwise.
4. Update the objective: `state = 'executing'`, stamp the agent and model
   identifiers, clear `completed_at`.
5. **Queue refill (`ensureDraftSlot`)** — the objective has now left the editable
   queue, so restore the next-up slot (Section 6): promote the lowest-position
   `future` to `draft` (clearing its `completed_at`), or if no `future` and no
   `draft` exists, insert a new **empty `draft`** inheriting the executing
   objective's `assigned_agent`.
6. **Session bookkeeping:** detach any prior active session for the objective
   (invariant #7), then create the new agent session.
7. **Execution request settlement:** mark the matching request `launched` (prefer a
   request ID threaded through attach metadata; fall back to the objective's active
   request). **Attach is the source of truth for a successful launch.** Settlement
   failures never fail attach; manual launches with no request are a no-op.
8. **Mission status:** move the mission to the project's `execute`-type status. If the
   previous status was `review`/`complete`-type, also emit a reopened event.
9. Fire-and-forget secondary automation: generate an objective title (see the
   `summarize-objective-title` automation in
   [`01-automations-overview.md`](../../../automations/docs/01-automations-overview.md)).

### 5.5 `executing` (and others) → `complete` — delivery

**Trigger:** the agent calls `deliver`. After persisting the delivery event,
artifacts, and change rationales:

1. Update the session's objective to `complete` with `completed_at = now()`,
   CAS-guarded on `state IN ('executing','pending_delivery','launching','draft')` —
   deliver completes the objective from any active state, but never resurrects an
   already-complete row.
2. Mark the agent session completed/detached **before** auto-advance runs, so
   launchers see no active session when the next `execution_requested` event arrives.
3. Run the **auto-advance decision** (5.6).
4. If auto-advance did **not** queue anything: move the mission to the project's
   `review`-type status, placed at the **top** of that board column, and emit a
   `status_change` event.

Other paths to `complete`:

- **Agent marks the mission complete:** a protocol `update` with a phase that maps to a
  `complete`-type status marks all `executing`/`pending_delivery` objectives on the
  mission `complete`.
- **Manual check-off (user):** sets any non-complete objective to `complete`. If it
  was still in the queue (`draft`/`launching`), run the queue refill
  (`ensureDraftSlot`, Section 6). Any active execution requests for the objective are
  cancelled. Idempotent for already-complete objectives.

### 5.6 Auto-advance decision (runs inside deliver)

After completing the delivered objective, inspect the **lowest-position `draft`** on
the mission:

```text
next_draft = lowest-position draft with non-empty instruction text
if none                     → no advance → mission goes to review
elif mission is human-only   → no advance
elif draft.auto_advance     → (requires assigned agent)
                              draft → launching, insert queued execution request,
                              emit execution_requested  → runner launches next agent
else (auto_advance = false) → emit blocking awaiting_approval event
                              (summary = objective.approval_reason or a default),
                              flag the mission as awaiting a response,
                              notify the user; objective STAYS draft
```

Notes:

- Auto-advance is **policy, not structure**: it only chooses whether the next draft
  _launches_ automatically. The queue-refill guarantee (Section 6) is unconditional
  and applies whether or not auto-advance is enabled.
- An **empty** draft (the auto-created refill slot) never auto-advances — the queue
  simply ends and the mission moves to review.
- The awaiting-approval branch counts as "advanced" for mission-status purposes: the
  mission does **not** move to review while an approval is pending.
- **Approval gating:** an agent can pre-gate a queued objective (set
  `auto_advance = false` plus an `approval_reason`). A user approves by setting
  `auto_advance = true`, which clears `approval_reason` and the mission's waiting flag;
  the objective then launches on the next trigger (manual run, or auto-advance after
  the next delivery). Toggling `auto_advance` is only allowed while the objective is
  in `draft`/`future`/`launching`; enabling it clears `approval_reason`.

### 5.7 → `pending_delivery` — follow-up work after a delivery

**Trigger:** after an objective has at least one delivery, a subsequent protocol
`update` or rationale-recording call carrying a **meaningful follow-up work signal**
transitions it to `pending_delivery`. Meaningful signals:

- any change rationales,
- a commit ID or diff stat in the snapshot,
- explicit follow-up intent of `pending_delivery`,
- non-empty artifacts/deliverables in the payload,
- an `update` event with execution intent (follow-up intent of `execution`, or an
  `execute` phase).

A bare "begin follow-up work" announcement is **not** itself a work signal — it merely
declares intent. The transition is CAS-guarded on
`state IN ('executing','launching','draft','complete')` — note this is the one
transition that can pull a `complete` objective back into the active set. Because of
invariant #2, a mission can hold only one `executing`-or-`pending_delivery` objective,
so pending redelivery blocks a second active objective.

`pending_delivery` resolves only via a new `deliver` (→ `complete`, per 5.5). A
delivery-status check reports redelivery as needed while an objective sits in this
state, prompting agents to re-deliver.

## 6. The "always a next slot" guarantee (`ensureDraftSlot`)

**Whenever the "next up" objective leaves the editable queue, the system immediately
restores a `draft` slot** so the user/agent always has a next objective to type into.
This guarantee is **unconditional** — it holds regardless of the `auto_advance`
preference and fires identically whether the transition came from a user action or
from automation.

`ensureDraftSlot` runs when the next-up objective:

- **attaches** (`→ executing`, 5.4 step 5),
- **is marked complete** while still queued (manual check-off, 5.5),
- **is demoted to `future`** — satisfied inherently, because demotion only happens
  when another objective is simultaneously made `draft` (promotion or mark-draft),
  so the slot is already filled and the refill is a no-op,
- or when an agent files follow-up work via protocol `create` with a session.

`draft → launching` does **not** trigger a refill: a launching objective is still a
kind of draft — editable and re-queueable — and remains the mission's next-up slot
until an agent attaches.

Refill order: promote the lowest-position `future`; otherwise insert an empty `draft`
inheriting the previous objective's `assigned_agent` (agent selection persists down
the queue; it only changes by explicit user/agent action). Combined with invariant #1,
the steady-state shape of a mission's queue is:

```text
[complete*] [executing|pending_delivery*] [one next-up: draft|launching] [future*]
            └ default: at most one; opt-in parallel across resource_key ┘
            └──── at most one draft ─────┘
```

(A `draft` and a `launching` objective may briefly coexist — e.g. a user promotes a
`future` while another objective is launching. Attach selection prefers `launching`
over `draft`, so the launch is unaffected.)

## 7. Companion state machine: execution requests

Launch automation is mediated by a durable queue (see
[`cli/docs/04-runner-and-launch-execution.md`](../../../cli/docs/04-runner-and-launch-execution.md)
and the `execution_requests` table in the schema contract). The happy path is
`queued` → `claimed` → `launching` → `launched`; terminal failure states (`failed`,
`cleared`, `cancelled`, `expired`) are reachable from any active status.

| Transition                                  | Trigger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `queued` → `claimed`                        | A runner polls for work.

| `claimed` → `launching`                     | Runner reports a successful child spawn. The spawn started; no agent has attached yet. The lease stays in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `claimed`/`launching`/`queued` → `launched` | The agent **attaches** (5.4 step 7).

| active → `failed`                           | (a) the runner reports a launch error; (b) a `claimed`/`launching` request's lease expires before attach — the next poll fails it and notifies the user with a retryable alert instead of silently relaunching.                                                                                                                                                  |

| active → `cancelled`                        | A poll finds the objective is no longer launchable (e.g. it was completed or reverted manually) and cancels the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| active → `expired`                          | Housekeeping expires stale requests past a retention boundary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Mapping to objective state: the objective sits in `launching` for the entire
`queued → launched` window. A failed request does **not** automatically revert the
objective out of `launching` (except the immediate creation-failure revert in 5.3);
`launching` remains a _launchable_ state precisely so a retry creates/reuses a request
without state gymnastics.

## 8. Mission status coupling

Objective transitions drive the mission's board status. Status names are configurable
per project, but status _types_ are stable (`draft`, `execute`, `review`, `complete`,
`blocked`, `cancelled` — see
[`cli/docs/06-core-domain-and-lifecycle.md`](../../../cli/docs/06-core-domain-and-lifecycle.md));
transitions resolve the project's preferred status name per type.

| Objective event                                                 | Mission effect                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent attaches (→ `executing`)                                  | Mission → `execute`-type status. If it was in `review`/`complete`, a reopened event is emitted. |
| Deliver with nothing auto-advanced                              | Mission → `review`-type status, top of the review column, marked unread — **unless** another objective is still `launching` / `executing` / `pending_delivery`, in which case the mission stays `execute`. |
| Deliver with auto-advance queued                                | Mission **stays** in execute; the next objective launches.                                      |
| Deliver gated on approval                                       | Mission stays put; flagged as awaiting a response, blocking `awaiting_approval` event.          |
| Agent `update` with a phase mapping to a `complete`-type status | All `executing`/`pending_delivery` objectives → `complete`.                                    |

## 9. Secondary automation on transitions

- **`completed_at`** — system-managed (invariant #6); manual writes are tolerated but
  unnecessary.
- **Titles** — generated fire-and-forget when an objective starts executing (and on
  manual complete) via the `summarize-objective-title` automation: plain truncation at
  or below the threshold, AI summarization above it, subject to the user's AI-title
  preference. Falls back to local derivation when the provider is unavailable.
- **`assigned_agent` inheritance** — every auto-created draft (refill or UI add)
  copies the most recent `assigned_agent` so the chosen agent/model persists down the
  queue; it only changes via explicit user/agent action.
- **`auto_advanced_at`** — stamped when auto-advance moves a draft to `launching`;
  cleared on revert.
- **Events** — every meaningful transition writes a mission event
  (`execution_requested`, `awaiting_approval`, `status_change`, alerts, system notes),
  which power the activity feed, notifications, and runner wake-ups. Objective state
  changes must be auditable from event history.

---

## 10. Suggested simplifications (vs. the upstream design)

These preserve the observable behavior above while reducing incidental complexity.
Where one conflicts with an existing reference spec, treat it as a proposal requiring
a contract review, not as license to diverge silently.

1. **One canonical refill routine, separate from auto-advance.** Upstream scatters
   refill/promote logic across attach, manual complete, and follow-up creation.
   Implement a single `ensureDraftSlot(mission)` service routine (promote lowest
   `future`, else insert empty draft with inherited agent) and call it as a
   postcondition of exactly the transitions in Section 6: attach, queued manual
   complete, and demotion (a structural no-op). The name matters — this is the
   unconditional structural guarantee, not the opt-in auto-advance policy, and
   neither flow should ever contain the other's logic.
2. **State transitions through one chokepoint.** Route every objective state write
   through a single transition function that applies the CAS guard, the
   `completed_at` rule, and event emission. Ad-hoc `UPDATE`s are how invariants rot.
3. **Avoid the `launching`/`launching` naming collision in code.** The schema fixes
   both names, but service code and logs should qualify them (`objective.launching`
   vs. `request.launching`) or alias the request status (e.g. "spawning") in internal
   naming, since the two windows differ and confusing them causes real bugs.
4. **No `submitted` state.** _(Adopted in this specification.)_ Upstream uses
   `submitted` to mark a draft "surfaced to an agent for discussion", but it behaves
   identically to `draft` for launch resolution and to `launching` for readers.
   This spec drops it: discussion does not change state, and `launching` is the only
   state between `draft` and `executing`. When interoperating with upstream data,
   map `submitted` to `draft`. The reference specs and schema contract still list
   `submitted`; removing it there is a coordinated contract change.
5. **Database-agnostic invariant enforcement.** Upstream leans on Postgres partial
   unique indexes and triggers. This project supports multiple adapters, so the
   portable contract is: enforce in the database where expressible, otherwise enforce
   in the service layer inside the same transaction, and cover both with the adapter
   conformance suite.
6. **Idempotency keys over heuristics.** Every automated request creation
   (auto-advance especially) carries a deterministic idempotency key
   (`auto_advance:<objective_id>`), making dedup a uniqueness property rather than a
   query-then-insert race.

---

## 11. Re-implementation checklist

To replicate this system, enforce — transactionally, not just in application code:

1. Per mission: ≤1 `draft`; ≤1 objective in (`executing` | `pending_delivery`); unique
   integer positions.
2. States beyond `draft`/`future` require non-empty instruction text.
3. Per objective: ≤1 active agent session; ≤1 in-flight execution request.
4. Canonical ordering everywhere: `position ASC, created_at ASC`; user reorders
   confined to the `draft`+`future` set, recycling that set's position pool.
5. State changes are CAS-guarded on the expected current state so concurrent triggers
   degrade to no-ops, never to duplicate transitions.
6. Discussion ≠ execution: discussing a mission leaves the draft in `draft`; only an
   explicit execution order changes state (`→ launching` or `→ executing`).
7. Refill the `draft` slot (promote next `future`, else create an empty draft
   inheriting the agent assignment) exactly when the next-up objective attaches, is
   completed while queued, or is demoted — never on `draft → launching`, since a
   launching objective is still the editable next-up slot. This refill is
   unconditional, independent of `auto_advance`.
8. Auto-advance only on explicit opt-in (`auto_advance = true`), only with non-empty
   text and an assigned agent, never on human-only missions; otherwise emit an
   approval gate instead of launching.
9. Delivery completes the objective _before_ deciding what runs next; if nothing
   advances, surface the mission for review.
10. Post-delivery work on a delivered objective re-opens it as `pending_delivery`,
    which blocks other active objectives until re-delivered.
