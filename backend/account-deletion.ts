/**
 * Self-service account deletion cascade.
 *
 * Invoked from Better Auth's `user.deleteUser` `beforeDelete` hook (see
 * `auth/src/auth/config.ts` and `backend/auth.ts`) before the auth `"user"`
 * row — and everything that hard-cascades from it (`session`, `account`,
 * `profiles`, `user_execution_target_preferences`) — is removed.
 *
 * `profiles` has three `ON DELETE RESTRICT` children (`workspace_users`,
 * `user_tokens`, `user_images`), and `workspace_users` itself has four more
 * (`role_assignments`, `user_tokens`, `workspace_user_execution_targets`,
 * `project_user_preferences`). `RESTRICT` blocks on row *existence*, not on
 * `deleted_at` — a tombstoned row still blocks the parent delete — so a soft
 * cascade can never unblock the profile's hard delete. Every row here is
 * exclusively owned by this profile (or by a `workspace_users` row that is
 * itself being removed), so once the identity is gone none of them have
 * standalone meaning; this hard-deletes them, which is the "service-managed
 * soft cascade for owned mutable children" default
 * (database/docs/09-database-schema-contract.md) applied to a case where the
 * parent's own removal is already a hard purge, not a tombstone. Each removal
 * still emits an `entity_changes` row so realtime/sync clients observe it, per
 * that doc's "a purge... must emit a purge outbox/change notification" rule.
 *
 * Unlike most service functions this intentionally spans every workspace the
 * profile belongs to, not just the active `WORKSPACE.id`: deleting an
 * identity removes it everywhere, not just from the current workspace.
 *
 * Every `recordChange` call here pins `actorWorkspaceUserId: null` instead of
 * letting it default to the ambient active workspace user: the caller (the
 * `beforeDelete` hook runs outside any request context) can easily resolve to
 * one of this very profile's own memberships, which would violate
 * `entity_changes`' FK the instant that row is purged below.
