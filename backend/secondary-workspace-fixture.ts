/**
 * The reusable A/B structural fixture for coo:331 (resource-derived workspace
 * scoping). It sets up the one scenario that catches the entire bug class:
 *
 *   a **resource lives in workspace B** while the caller's **active workspace is A**,
 *   both under the one bootstrapped profile (an ADMIN of both).
 *
 * Every workspace-scoped operation must resolve against the *resource's* workspace
 * (B), not the ambient/active one (A). The origin bug (Phase 0) was agent launch
 * config being saved in A but read by `launchObjective` from the objective's own
 * workspace B, so a mission run from a secondary workspace launched with an empty
 * config. As Phase 2 converts each remaining ambient read, a test built on this
 * fixture asserts the converted endpoint reads/writes against B — so the bug class
 * is caught at the door for every newly-converted endpoint.
 *
 * `setupSecondaryWorkspaceFixture` mirrors the inline setup the other suites in
 * `mission-secondary-workspace.test.ts` repeat by hand: bootstrap A, create B,
 * switch active back to A, then create a project (with a primary resource that
 * provisions B's acting-device execution target), a mission, and an objective —
 * all in B. Callers then exercise a scoped operation and assert it lands in B.
