# 02 — Mission Board

The default landing screen and the primary way to see and move work. A
Kanban-style board grouped by mission status, with a dense list alternative, live
filters, search, mission creation, and a quick-run affordance.

**Route:** `/p/:projectId/board` (kanban) · `?view=list` (list) · all filter and
search state lives in search params so the view is deep-linkable.

---

## Kanban view

Columns are the project's `project_statuses`, ordered by their configured order and
colored by `status_type` (doc 00 §6.2). One card per mission.

### MissionCard contents

| Element | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `display_id` (`1:1429`, mono) | `missions.display_id` | copyable; click → mission detail |
| Title | `missions.title` | truncated, 2 lines |
| Objective progress | objectives states | "exec 2/4", "✓ 3/3", "◷ 2 obj" |
| Live agent strip | active `agent_sessions` | `🤖 agent·model` + pulsing live dot + heartbeat age while `executing` |
| Attention markers | events / requests | `❓ ask`, `⛔ failed launch`, `✦ delivery ready`, `▷ run` (quick-run) |
| Changed files | `changed_files` count | "⌫ N files" when tracked |
| Priority | `missions.priority` | left border / `PriorityTag` (`low/normal/high/urgent`) |
| Tags (gated G5) | `mission_tag_assignments` | `TagChip`s |

### Movement

- **Drag/drop** a card between columns issues a status change through the
  service layer (`PATCH /missions/:id` status → mirrors a `status_change` event).
  The card moves optimistically and reconciles against the returned revision; a
  rejected move (e.g. invalid transition / RBAC denial) snaps back with the reason.
- An **explicit status menu** on each card (⋯) is the keyboard/non-drag path and
  the accessible default.
- Moving a mission **does not** reorder its objectives or destroy session history
  (contract invariant) — the board only changes `missions.status_id`.

---

## List view

Denser, sortable, better for review and scanning many missions.

```
Board · Open0 · List                       [filters as above]      [+ New mission]
ID       Title                 Status    Pri    Objectives  Agent       Updated   Files
1:1429   Build React UI        execute●  high   exec 2/4    claude·opus  6s ago    —
1:1421   Token rotation        review    normal ✓ 4/4       —            12m       4
1:1431   Add OAuth provider    next-up   high   2 draft     —            1h        —
1:1418   Fix scheduler race    blocked   urgent ❓ ask       codex        3h        2
```

- Sort by updated/created/priority/status. Columns mirror the card fields.
- Live row updates from the same change feed; the `execute●` dot pulses for active
  work and "Updated" ticks.

## Calendar view

Scrollable day grid for missions with due dates. View preference is persisted in
`localStorage` per project (same key as board/list); filters from the board header
apply identically.

```

### MissionCalendarCard contents

| Element | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Background tint | project color | ~14% opacity with project-color border |
| Checkbox | `MissionCompleteCheckbox` | marks complete via workspace `complete` status |
| Title | `missions.title` | single line, strikethrough when complete |
| `display_id` | `missions.display_id` | mono, optional |
| Click | card body | opens mission detail panel |
| Drag | entire card (not checkbox) | drop on another day to change due date |

### Movement

- **Drag/drop** between day cells updates `missions.due_datetime` through
  `PATCH /missions/:id`. The card moves optimistically and reverts on error.
  Time-of-day is preserved when the mission already had a due date; otherwise noon
  UTC is used.
- **Within-day order** follows `board_position` then `sequence_number`; no
  within-day reorder in v1.
- Missions **without** a due date are omitted from the grid. When filters leave
  dated missions, the calendar shows them; when none have due dates, an empty state
  prompts users to set dates in the mission panel.

### Scroll & layout

- Vertical infinite scroll: sentinel observers extend the visible month window by
  one month when the user nears the top or bottom edge (initial window: today
  ±3 months).
- Sticky weekday row and month headers remain visible while scrolling.
- Today is highlighted on its day cell; the selected mission card uses the same
  `bg-primary/10` ring treatment as list view.
- On first mount, the view scrolls to center today.

---

## Filters & search

A single filter bar shared by all views, all reflected in URL search params:

- **Status** (multi-select over `project_statuses`)
- **Priority** (`low/normal/high/urgent`)
- **Agent/model** (assigned/active agent)
- **Assignee** (gated G1; hidden in single-user mode)
- **Tag** (gated G5)
- **Updated** range
- **Text filter** — quick client-side filter over loaded cards; the full
  cross-workspace ranked search is the `⌘K`/`/search` surface (doc 10). When
  Group 8 (search) is absent, text filter is client-side only + exact `display_id`.

---

## Create mission

A modal (board stays behind, deep-linkable as `?new=1`). Mirrors `ovld create` /
`POST /protocol/create`.

```
New mission · Open0
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title            [ _______________________________________ ]   │
│ First objective* [ multi-line objective / prompt text …    ]   │
│                  [                                          ]   │
│ Priority [ normal ▾ ]   Status [ next-up ▾ ]   Tags [+]        │
│ ▸ Advanced (constraints, output format)                        │
│ ▸ Objectives (add more ordered objectives now)                 │
│ Agent [ claude ▾ ] Model [ opus ▾ ] Effort [ high ▾ ]          │
│ Auto-advance [x]                                               │
│ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│           [ Cancel ]  [ Create draft ]  [ Create & run ▾ ]     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Create draft** → mission with `draft`/`next-up` status, objective in `draft`
  (`POST /protocol/create`).
- **Create & run** → create then queue execution for the first objective
  (`POST /protocol/prompt` or create + `request-execution`); requires a runnable
  working directory or it surfaces the repair before queuing.
- **Advanced** exposes the mission fields agents consume: `constraints_text`,
  `output_format_text`.
- **Objectives** lets the user add multiple ordered objectives up front (one mission,
  several agent passes) — the canonical "mission = goal, objective = step" model.

---

## Data + realtime

| Region | Read | Realtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Columns/rows | `GET /missions?projectId=&status=&…` → `['missions', projectId, filtersHash]` | `mission` insert/update/delete deltas → patch the affected card/row and move between columns on status change |
| Card progress / live strip | objectives + active `agent_sessions` (embedded or `['mission', id]`) | `objective`, `agent_session`, `mission_event` deltas |
| Attention markers | `ask`/`permission_request`/failed `execution_request`/`delivery` events | corresponding deltas; also feed the topbar ⚠ counter |
| Quick-run | `POST /protocol/request-execution` | `execution_request` + `objective` deltas reflect queued→launching→executing |

The board holds one realtime subscription scoped to the project; every delta maps
to a single card/row mutation so the board reflects agent activity with no refresh.

---

## States

- **Empty (no missions):** `EmptyState` — "No missions yet. Create your first
  mission" + `CopyCommand: ovld create "<objective>"`.
- **Empty column:** subtle "Nothing in {status}".
- **Loading:** column/row skeletons matching final density.
- **Filtered-empty:** "No missions match these filters" + clear-filters.
- **Quick-run blocked:** if no primary working directory, the `▷ run` affordance
  shows the repair (`ovld add-cwd` / link directory) instead of silently failing.

---

## Capability gating

- Assignee filter & avatars: Group 1 (else hidden).
- Tag chips & tag filter: Group 5 (else hidden).
- Ranked text search: Group 8 (else client-side filter + `display_id` lookup).
- Drag-to-move and create are gated by RBAC `mission:update` / `mission:create` when
  Group 1 is installed.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- The board is the post-launch landing screen and shows all of a project's missions
  grouped by status.
- An objective transitioning `submitted → launching → executing → complete` moves
  and updates its card live, including the agent strip and heartbeat age, with no
  manual refresh.
- A mission with a pending `ask` or a failed launch is visually flagged on its card
  and counted in the topbar attention cluster.
- Filters and the chosen view (kanban/list/calendar) survive reload via URL state
  for filters; view mode is stored in `localStorage` per project.
- A user can create a mission with one or several ordered objectives, optionally
  queue the first for execution, and the quick-run path surfaces a repair when no
  working directory is linked.
- Running the board with only core groups hides assignee, tag, and ranked-search
  affordances with no broken controls.
