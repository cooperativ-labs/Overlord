# 03 — Mission Detail

The core screen of the application. A mission is the durable goal and review
record; this page is where humans plan objectives, watch agents execute them live,
and read the accumulating shared context and history. It is the web equivalent of
`ovld mission context`, `ovld attach`, and the activity timeline combined.

**Route (target):** `/p/:projectId/missions/:missionId` with `?tab=activity|objectives|context|artifacts|changes`.
Opens as a full route (deep-linkable, reload-safe), never a modal.

> **Status — target vs. as-built.** Most of this document describes the *target*
> mission-detail screen (objective rail, tabs, live activity timeline). The first
> realtime slice ships a much simpler presentation. The [As-built](#as-built-mission-presentation-current-slice)
> section below documents exactly what renders today and the deviations that need
> ratifying; everything from [Target layout](#target-layout) onward is the design
> we are building toward.

## As-built mission presentation (current slice)

What `webapp/web/pages/MissionPage.tsx` renders today: a single full-route screen
(`/projects/:projectId/missions/:missionId`) with a **header** and a centred,
single-column **objective list** — no rail, no tabs, no activity timeline. Every
text field is inline click-to-edit (`EditableText`); every change is a REST
mutation that the global realtime feed reconciles. There is no execution, review,
context, artifacts, or changes surface yet — those stay CLI-only for this slice.

### Header (`MissionHeader`)

| Element | Source DTO | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Breadcrumb | route params | Projects / board (→ `/projects/:projectId`) / `displayId` (mono) |
| Title | `title` | inline `EditableText` → `PATCH /api/missions/:id { title }` |
| Status badge | `statusType` → `statusClasses` | read-only colour chip of the current status |
| Delete | — | `confirm()` → `DELETE /api/missions/:id` (soft-deletes mission + objectives) → navigate to board |
| Status field | `statusId` + project `statuses` | `Select` → `PATCH … { statusId }` |
| Priority field | `priority` | `Select` (`low/normal/high/urgent`) → `PATCH … { priority }` + colour `Badge` |

### Objective list (`ObjectiveItem`)

A flat, ordered list of `Card`s — one per objective — with an `+ Add objective`
affordance below. Each card:

| Element | Source | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Position | `position` | `#{position + 1}` mono pill |
| Title | `title` | inline `EditableText` → `PATCH /api/objectives/:id { title }` |
| State | `state` | `Select` over all seven `ObjectiveState`s → `PATCH … { state }` **directly** |
| Delete | — | `confirm()` → `DELETE /api/objectives/:id` |
| Instruction | `instructionText` | multiline `EditableText` → `PATCH … { instructionText }` |

**Add objective** is a button that expands into a textarea; submitting issues
`POST /api/objectives { missionId, instructionText }`. New objectives take the
server's defaults — there are no agent / model / effort / auto-advance / attachment
controls in the UI yet.

### Data + realtime (as-built)

- The page reads `GET /api/missions/:id` → `MissionDetailDto` (mission + `objectives`
  + project `statuses`) under the `['mission', id]` query key.
- Realtime is **not** mission-scoped. The app holds one global SSE connection
  (`GET /realtime`, with `GET /api/stream` as a compatibility alias); reconnect
  catch-up reads `GET /sync/changes?after=<seq>` before trusting the stream
  cursor. `entity_changes` deltas are routed to targeted TanStack Query
  invalidations for mission detail, mission events, project mission lists, My
  Missions, branch, and objective-scoped queries where possible. Refreshes,
  malformed deltas, missing routing IDs, unknown entity types, and unavailable
  catch-up still trigger a broad invalidation. Mutations also invalidate eagerly
  so the originating user sees their edit immediately. The connection's
  Live / Connecting / Reconnecting state shows in the sidebar, not on this page.

### Gap to target

Deferred (and CLI-only) for this slice: the left **objective rail**, the
**Activity / Objectives / Context / Artifacts / Changes tabs**, the
**`AgentSessionStrip` + `ActivityTimeline`** (no `mission_events` rendering at all),
**attention banners** (ask / permission_request / failed launch), **Run objective**
and **Review** actions, the **shared-context / artifacts / changes** panels, the
per-objective **agent / model / effort / flags / auto-advance / attachment** editor,
and all **capability gating** (this is a single-user local console).

### Deviations to ratify

1. **Route shape.** Ships as `/projects/:projectId/missions/:missionId` (board
   `/projects/:projectId`), not the `/p/:projectId/...` paths in this spec. Pick one
   convention and align the router and these docs.
2. **Objective state is directly editable.** The card writes `objectives.state`
   straight from a `Select`, contradicting this doc's invariant that *"the UI never
   advances an objective state itself."* With no runner/protocol surface yet, this is
   a deliberate manual override (it lets the local console set e.g. `executing` /
   `complete` by hand); it must become a request-and-reconcile transition once
   execution lands.
3. **Status & priority are plain `Select`s**, not the status-menu / inline-priority
   affordances the target describes.
4. **Add objective uses `POST /api/objectives`** (direct REST create), not
   `POST /protocol/add-objectives`; converge when the protocol-backed service layer
   lands.
5. **Destructive deletes** for both mission and objective are exposed via `confirm()`
   dialogs; the target only offers *archive* in the ⋯ menu.

## Target layout

A persistent header, a left objective rail, and a tabbed main panel.

## Header

| Element | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `display_id` + title | `missions.display_id`, `title` | title inline-editable (RBAC `mission:update`) |
| Status badge | `missions.status_type` | click → status menu (same transitions as board) |
| Meta line | project, `priority`, `execution_target_intent_json`, creator, `updated_at` | priority editable inline |
| Primary actions | — | **Run objective** (doc 04), **Add objective**, **Review →** (appears when status is `review` / a delivery exists), and contextual **Ask shown** / **Resume follow-up** |
| ⋯ menu | — | edit constraints/output, change priority, change assignee (G1), archive |

The header also hosts **attention banners** (full-width, dismiss-to-act): a
pending `ask` ("Agent is blocked: …  [Answer]"), a `permission_request`
("Agent requests tool X  [Approve]/[Deny]" — gated G4), or a failed launch
("Launch failed: no working directory  [Fix]"). These mirror the topbar counter.

---

## Objective rail (left)

Ordered list of the mission's objectives — the heart of the planning model
(one objective = one agent pass).

```
1 ✓ Plan IA            complete      ◷ done 3m ago
2 ● Write docs         executing  🤖 claude·opus   ▓▓▓░ live
3 ◷ Implement runtime  draft       ▷ run   ⋮ reorder
4 ◷ Add tests          future      (hidden chain)
   [ + Add objective ]
```

Per `ObjectiveRow`:

- **State pill** with the objective vocabulary (`future`, `draft`, `submitted`,
  `launching`, `executing`, `pending_delivery`, `complete`) — visually distinct
  from mission status (doc 00 §6.2).
- **Assigned agent/model/effort** (`assigned_agent`, `model`, `reasoning_effort`).
- **Live indicator** when an `agent_session` is attached (`executing`).
- **Per-objective actions:** Run (doc 04), Edit, Reorder (drag, draft/future
  only), Attach file, Approval-gate toggle (`auto_advance`).
- Selecting an objective focuses the main panel's session/activity on that
  objective and scopes the Changes tab.

### Objective editor

Inline/expanding editor for the selected objective (mirrors objective fields):

```
Objective 3 · Implement runtime                         state: draft  [ Save ]
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title         [ Implement runtime ]                                    │
│ Instruction*  [ multi-line agent-facing instruction_text …          ] │
│ Agent [ claude ▾ ]  Model [ opus ▾ ]  Effort [ high ▾ ]  Flags [+]     │
│ Auto-advance [x]    Attachments: design.png ⌫  [ + attach ]            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
[ Save draft ]  [ Submit for execution ]  [ Run now ]
```

- Editing is allowed for `draft`/`future`; `executing`/`complete` objectives are
  read-only with their history. `submitted` can be unsubmitted back to `draft`.
- **Submit** → `POST /protocol/discuss-objective` (draft → submitted).
- **Add objective** → `POST /protocol/add-objectives` (appends ordered objective;
  used when work is a sequential step toward the same goal).
- **Attachments are objective-scoped** (not mission-scoped): upload via
  `attachment-prepare-upload`/`finalize-upload`; the active objective's
  attachments are what an attached agent sees.
- **Reorder** persists `objectives.position` for draft/future objectives only.

---

## Tabs (main panel)

### Activity (default)
- `AgentSessionStrip` at top for the active/most-recent session: agent, model,
  `phase`, `delivery_state`, started time, and a **ticking heartbeat age**
  (`last_heartbeat_at`) that goes stale (amber) past threshold and offers the
  failure/clear path.
- `ActivityTimeline` renders `mission_events` newest-first, append-only, with one
  `EventItem` renderer per type:

  | `mission_events.type` | Rendering |
  | --- | --- |
  | `update` | progress narrative; expandable; shows linked changed-files when present. An update whose summary opens with a `Follow-up:` marker is an agent-relayed human message and renders as `user_follow_up` |
  | `user_follow_up` | human message, verbatim, attributed to the user: the actor's avatar replaces the type icon and their name replaces the type label, with no phase badge |
  | `alert` | non-blocking warning style |
  | `discussion_summary` | pinned-style conclusion |
  | `decision` | decision callout |
  | `ask` | blocking question; inline **Answer** box (posts `user_follow_up`/`decision`) |
  | `permission_request` | tool request; **Approve/Deny** (gated G4) |
  | `delivery` | delivery summary card + link to Review tab |
  | `execution_requested` | "queued for runner" with request id |
  | `awaiting_approval` | auto-advance paused; **Approve to continue** |
  | `status_change` | compact mission/objective transition chip |

- New events **slide in** at the top with a highlight; existing events never
  reorder. A "filter events" control hides `status_change`/heartbeat noise.

### Objectives
- Full-width version of the rail with all objective fields, history per objective,
  and the completion timeline (which session delivered which objective).

### Context
- Collapsed-by-default **Shared State** footer on the mission panel (web + desktop SPA).
- `shared_context_entries` for the mission: key, value (string/JSON, syntax-aware),
  tags. This is the durable memory that later objectives inherit. Add/edit via
  `PUT /api/missions/:id/context` (same upsert as Protocol `write-context`);
  list via `GET /api/missions/:id/context`. Read-only display warns against pasting
  secrets (per security boundaries).

### Artifacts
- Delivery artifacts grouped by `artifacts.type` (`test_results`, `next_steps`,
  `note`, `url`, `decision`, `migration`). See doc 05 for the full review surface;
  this tab is the quick inline view. Large files are objective attachments, not
  inline artifacts.

### Changes
- Embedded view of doc 06 scoped to this mission (and selected objective): changed
  files, attribution metadata, and optional rationale annotations.

## Data + realtime

| Region | Read | Realtime delta → effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header / status | `GET /missions/:id` → `['mission', id]` | `mission` update → patch header |
| Objective rail | objectives in mission payload | `objective` update → state pill / live dot |
| Session strip | active `agent_sessions` | `agent_session` update + heartbeat → strip + age |
| Activity | `GET /missions/:id/events` → `['mission', id, 'events']` | `mission_event` insert → prepend `EventItem` |
| Context | `GET /api/missions/:id/context` | `shared_context_entry` deltas |
| Artifacts | `GET /missions/:id/deliveries` | `delivery`/`artifact` deltas |
| Changes | `GET /api/missions/:id/file-changes` | `changed_file`/`change_rationale` inserts and updates invalidate the projection |

One realtime subscription scoped to `mission:<id>` (a `stream_key` the change feed
supports) drives all of the above. Heartbeats update the session strip age but do
**not** create timeline rows (per the contract).

---

## Actions → protocol/REST map

| UI action | Endpoint (mirrors `ovld protocol`) |
| --- | --- |
| Edit title/priority/fields | `PATCH /missions/:id` |
| Add objective | `POST /protocol/add-objectives` |
| Edit/reorder objective | `PATCH …/objectives/:id` |
| Submit objective | `POST /protocol/discuss-objective` |
| Run objective | `POST /protocol/request-execution` (doc 04) |
| Answer an ask | `POST /protocol/update --event-type user_follow_up`/`decision` |
| Approve/deny permission (G4) | `POST /protocol/permission-request` resolution |
| Approve auto-advance gate | resolve `awaiting_approval` → queue next (doc 04) |
| Write context | `PUT /api/missions/:id/context` |
| Attach file to objective | `attachment-prepare-upload` → upload → `attachment-finalize-upload` |
| Move mission status | `PATCH /missions/:id` status |

The UI **never** advances an objective state itself; it requests the transition
and reflects the authoritative result from the change feed. (The current slice
temporarily violates this — see [As-built deviation 2](#deviations-to-ratify) — by
writing `objectives.state` directly until the execution/protocol surface exists.)

---

## States

- **Loading:** header first, then rail, then activity skeleton.
- **No objectives:** rail shows "Add the first objective" + `ovld protocol add-objectives` hint.
- **Idle (no active session):** session strip shows "No agent attached" with **Run**.
- **Blocked (ask):** header banner + the ask pinned in the timeline with an answer box.
- **Pending delivery:** objective shows `pending_delivery`; header offers **Finish
  follow-up** path; explains a follow-up delivery is needed.
- **Conflict (409):** an edit collided with a newer revision → refetch + "changed
  elsewhere, re-apply?".

---

## Capability gating

- Assignee field & actor attribution on events: Group 1 (else "you"/agent only).
- Permission-request approve/deny: Group 4 (else permission requests appear as
  read-only `alert`-style notes if surfaced at all).
- Tag editing: Group 5.
- Edits/actions gated by RBAC capabilities (`mission:update`, `objective:submit`,
  `session:attach`, `event:create`) when Group 1 is installed.

---

## Acceptance criteria

- Opening a mission shows its objectives in order, the active objective's live
  session, and the full activity timeline — without reading the original agent chat.
- A user can watch an executing objective update in place: new progress updates
  appear at the top of the timeline and the session heartbeat age ticks, with no
  refresh.
- A user can add, edit, reorder (draft/future), submit, and attach files to
  objectives, and each action maps to the corresponding protocol command.
- A blocking `ask` is unmistakable (header banner + pinned event) and answerable
  inline; answering records a follow-up without forcing redelivery.
- Shared context written by an earlier objective is visible and editable here and
  inherited by later objectives.
- The page never performs an objective/mission state transition locally; it always
  reflects the change feed's authoritative result.
