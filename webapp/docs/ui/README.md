# Overlord Web Interface — UI Design Documents

This directory is the detailed design specification for the Overlord web
control center: the **realtime React interface** that sits on top of the REST +
realtime boundary owned by the [webapp module](../../README.md) (contract
component `rest`).

These documents describe the **ideal** UI in detail. They are design specs, not
implementation — with one exception: [03 — Mission Detail](03-mission-detail.md) now
also carries an **As-built** section that documents how individual missions are
actually presented in the first shipped slice and the deviations from this spec
that need ratifying. They assume the stack already recommended for this module —
**Vite + React + TypeScript + TanStack Router + TanStack Query + Serwist** (see
[framework-recommendation.md](../framework-recommendation.md)) — and they map
every screen, component, and action back to a real Overlord capability
defined in the module specs and the [schema contract](../../../database/docs/09-database-schema-contract.md).

Once you have read this set, the [Implementation Plan](../implementation-plan.md)
turns these designs into a dependency-ordered build sequence (contract-first API,
realtime spine first, a vertical slice, then breadth, then capability-gated
surfaces).

## For Users

### Scope boundaries

These constraints come from the contract and module specs and shape every screen
in the design set:

- **The UI is a peer of the CLI, not the source of truth.** Every lifecycle
  transition runs through the same service layer as `ovld`. The web app calls
  REST endpoints that mirror `ovld protocol`; it never owns state transitions.
- **Realtime is driven by `entity_changes`.** The UI subscribes to `/realtime`
  (SSE/WebSocket backed by the change feed) and catches up via `/sync/changes?after=<seq>`.
  Active agent work must update on screen without a manual refresh.
- **File evidence is metadata-only.** The UI reads objective-ledger paths and
  optional rationale annotations; it does not scan the worktree, upload repository
  contents, or perform VCS mutations.
- **Capability gating is first-class.** Overlord installs in
  [core + à-la-carte table groups](../../../database/docs/10-database-table-groups.md).
  Pages and panels that depend on a group (auth, tags, search, connector
  monitoring) must degrade gracefully when that group is absent.
- **No secrets in the UI.** Raw `USER_TOKEN` and session-key secrets are shown
  exactly once at creation and never re-displayed; the change feed and DTOs are
  already secret-redacted.

## For Developers

### How to read this set

Start with the structure document, then read the page documents in order. Each
page document is self-contained and follows the same template (purpose, route,
layout wireframe, components, data + realtime sources, states, actions, capability
gating, acceptance criteria).

| # | Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Source material

These designs were derived from the Overlord specs current in the repo:
the root [README](../../../README.md) and [CONTRACT](../../../CONTRACT.md);
the CLI/protocol/runner/review specs under [`cli/docs/`](../../../cli/docs/);
the connector spec under [`connectors/docs/`](../../../connectors/docs/);
the auth/RBAC specs under [`auth/docs/`](../../../auth/docs/);
the [schema contract](../../../database/docs/09-database-schema-contract.md) and
[table groups](../../../database/docs/10-database-table-groups.md);
and the existing [web-app requirements](../web-app.md).
