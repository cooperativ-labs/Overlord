/**
 * Declarative catalog of mission "status indicators" — the single source of truth
 * for what each notifiable / seen-tracked mission status *is* (its label, corner-dot
 * color, seen-tracking behavior, and native-notification profile).
 *
 * Two thin, independent pipelines consume these descriptors instead of each
 * re-encoding a per-status list:
 *   - Card indicators: {@link ../pages/missionCardState.ts#getMissionCardState}
 *     maps `MissionDto` flags to the active indicators, and
 *     {@link ../pages/MissionCardStateOverlay.tsx} renders their corner dots.
 *   - Durable notification rendering: server rows use this catalog's fixed
 *     descriptors; the webapp never derives workflow candidates from status changes.
 *
 * Adding a new status is a catalog entry here plus (for card indicators) one
 * `MissionDto` flag and one aggregate. The catalog is intentionally a static,
 * code-owned module — statuses ship with their own rendering + sound assets, so
 * they are a closed set, not DB-configured data.
 *
 * Scope: this catalog is for *corner indicators / notifiable mission statuses*.
 * It deliberately does not model every card affordance — the executing "shimmer"
 * is an animated full-card overlay driven by live objective state, not a
 * seen-tracked corner dot, so it stays special-cased in the card state.
